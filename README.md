# Qt Creator

Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE for development with the Qt framework.

## Supported Platforms

The standalone binary packages support the following platforms:

Windows XP SP3 or later
(K)Ubuntu Linux 11.10 (32-bit and 64-bit) or later
Mac OS X 10.7 or later

Building the sources requires Qt 5.4.0 or later.

## Compiling Qt Creator

Prerequisites:

* Qt 5.4.0 or later
* On Windows:
    * ActiveState Active Perl
    * MinGW with g++ 4.7 or Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 or later
    * jom
* On Mac OS X: latest Xcode
* On Linux: g++ 4.7 or later

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Qt Creator with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

## Compiling Qt and Qt Creator on Windows

This section provides step by step instructions for compiling the latest
versions of Qt and Qt Creator on Windows. Alternatively, to avoid having to
compile Qt yourself, you can use one of the versions of Qt shipped with the Qt
SDK (release builds of Qt using MinGW and Visual C++ 2013 or later).
For detailed information on the supported compilers, see
<https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git> .

   1.  Decide which compiler to use: MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio. If you
       plan to contribute to Qt Creator, you should compile your changes with
       both compilers.

   2.  Install msysGit from <https://msysgit.github.io/>. If you plan to
       use the MinGW compiler suite, do not choose to put git in the
       default path of Windows command prompts. For more information, see
       step 9.

   3.  Create a working directory under which to check out Qt and Qt Creator,
       for example, `c:\work`. If you plan to use MinGW and Microsoft Visual
       Studio simultaneously or mix different Qt versions, we recommend
       creating a directory structure which reflects that. For example:
       `C:\work\qt5.4.1-vs12, C:\work\qt5.4.1-mingw`.

   4.  Download and install Perl from <https://www.activestate.com/activeperl>
       and check that perl.exe is added to the path. Run `perl -v` to verify
       that the version displayed is 5.10 or later. Note that git ships
       an outdated version 5.8 which cannot be used for Qt.

   5.  In the working directory, check out the respective branch of Qt from
       <https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qt5.git> (we recommend the latest released version).

   6.  Check out Qt Creator (master branch or latest version, see
       <https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git>).
       You should now have the directories qt and creator under your working
       directory.

   7.  Install a compiler:
       - For a MinGW toolchain for Qt, see <https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW> .

       - For Microsoft Visual C++, install the Windows SDK and the "Debugging
         Tools for Windows" from the SDK image. We strongly recommend using the
         64-bit version and 64-bit compilers on 64-bit systems.

         For the Visual C++ compilers, it is recommended to use the tool 'jom'.
         It is a replacement for nmake that utilizes all CPU cores and thus
         speeds up compilation significantly. Download it from
         <https://download.qt.io/official_releases/jom>
         and add the executable to the path.

   8.  For convenience, we recommend creating shell prompts with the correct
       environment. This can be done by creating a .bat-file
       (such as, `<working_directory>\qtvars.bat`) that contains the environment
       variable settings.
       A `.bat`-file for MinGW looks like:

         set PATH=<path_to_qt>\[qtbase\]bin;<path_to_mingw>\bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-g++

       For the Visual C++ compilers, call the `.bat` file that sets up the
       environment for the compiler (provided by the Windows SDK or the
       compiler):

         CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
         set PATH=<path_to_qt>\[qtbase\]bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2013

       You can create desktop links to the `.bat` files using the working
       directory and specifying

        %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /E:ON /V:ON  /k <working_directory>\qtvars.bat

   9.  When using MinGW, open the shell prompt and enter:

        sh.exe

       That should result in a `sh is not recognized as internal or external
       command...` error. If a `sh.exe` is found, the compile process will fail.
       You have to remove it from the path.

  10.  You are now ready to configure and build Qt and Qt Creator.
       Please see <https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git> for
       recommended configure-options for Qt 5.
       To use MinGW, open the the shell prompt and enter:

         cd <path_to_qt>
         configure <configure_options> && mingw32-make -s
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && mingw32-make -s

       To use the Visual C++ compilers, enter:

         cd <path_to_qt>
         configure <configure_options> && jom
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && jom

   11. To launch Qt Creator, enter:
       qtcreator

   12. When using  Visual C++ with the "Debugging Tools for Windows" installed,
       the extension library `qtcreatorcdbext.dll` to be loaded into the
       Windows console debugger (`cdb.exe`) should have been built under
       `lib\qtcreatorcdbext32` or `lib\qtcreatorcdbext64`.
       When using a 32 bit-build of Qt Creator with the 64 bit version of the
       "Debugging Tools for Windows" the library should also be built with
       a 64 bit compiler (rebuild `src\libs\qtcreatorcdbext` using a 64 bit
       compiler).

       If you are building 32 bit and running on a 64 bit
       Windows, you can obtain the 64 bit versions of the extension library
       and the binary `win64interrupt.exe`, which is required for
       debugging from the repository
       <https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/binary-artifacts.git/tree> .

   13. Qt Creator can be registered as a post-mortem debugger. This
       can be done in the options page or by running the tool qtcdebugger
       with administrative privileges passing the command line options
       -register/unregister, respectively. Alternatively,
       the required registry entries

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug

       can be modified using the registry editor regedt32 to contain

        <path>\qt-creator\bin\qtcdebugger %ld %ld

       When using a self-built version of Qt Creator as post-mortem debugger, it needs to be
       able to find all dependent Qt-libraries and plugins when being launched by the
       system. The easiest way to provide them for Qt 5 is to run the tool windeployqt:

        windeployqt -quick -qmldir share\qtcreator\welcomescreen -qmldir src\plugins\qmlprofiler bin\qtcreator.exe lib\qtcreator lib\qtcreator\plugins

Note that unlike on Unix, you cannot overwrite executables that are running.
Thus, if you want to work on Qt Creator using Qt Creator, you need a
separate build of it. We recommend using a separate, release-built version
of Qt and Qt Creator to work on a debug-built version of Qt and Qt Creator
or using shadow builds.
