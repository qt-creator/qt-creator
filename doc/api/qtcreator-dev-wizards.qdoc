    \title Creating Wizards in Code

    \section1 Introduction

    If the functionality provided by template-based
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-wizards.html}{custom wizards}
    is not sufficient for your case, you can write wizards in code.

    A wizard in \QC is an instance of a class implementing
    the Core::IWizardFactory interface that is registered with
    ExtensionSystem::PluginManager.

    Implementing wizards requires:
    \list
    \li Writing a factory class that derives from Core::IWizardFactory. This is
        a very generic interface that does not make any assumption about what
        the wizard does and what its UI looks like.

    \li Providing a set of parameters that determine how the wizard shows up
        in the list of wizards in the  \uicontrol {New File or Project} dialog.

        When deriving from Core::IWizardFactory, the constructor has to call
        the following setters provided by the base class:

        \list
        \li \c setId
        \li \c setWizardKind
        \li \c setIcon
        \li \c setDescription
        \li \c setDisplayName
        \li \c setCategory
        \li \c setDisplayCategory
        \li \c setDescriptionImage
        \li \c setRequiredFeatures
        \li \c setFlags
        \endlist

    \li Implementing the wizard UI

        Typically, this will be a class derived from Utils::Wizard.
        Utils::Wizard extends QWizard with the functionality to show a progress
        bar on the left.

    \li Implementing the wizard functionality

        It is recommended to use Core::GeneratedFile to represent files
        that need to be written to disk. They allow to delay writing the actual
        data to disk till the wizard is done.
    \endlist

    \section2 Relevant Classes

    \table
        \header
            \li Class
            \li Description

        \row
            \li Core::IWizardFactory
            \li \QC wizard interface, implementations of which are registered
                with ExtensionSystem::PluginManager.

        \row
            \li Core::GeneratedFile
            \li A file containing name, contents, and some attributes.

        \row
            \li Utils::FileWizardPage
            \li Introductory wizard page asking for file name and path.

        \row
            \li Utils::ProjectIntroPage
            \li Introductory wizard page asking for project name and path.
    \endtable

    \section2 Setters and Getters of IWizardFactory

    The setters and getters listed below determine how the wizard shows up
    in the list of wizards in the  \uicontrol {New File or Project} dialog.

    \table
        \header
            \li Type
            \li Parameter Name
            \li Description

        \row
            \li Core::IWizardFactory::WizardKind
            \li kind
            \li Enumeration value that indicates the type of the wizard
                (\c project or \c file).

        \row
            \li QIcon
            \li icon
            \li Icon to show.

        \row
            \li QString
            \li description
            \li Descriptive text.

        \row
            \li QString
            \li displayName
            \li Name to be shown in the list.

        \row
            \li QString
            \li id
            \li Unique identifier for the wizard. It also determines the order
                within a category.

        \row
            \li QString
            \li category
            \li Identifier of the category under which the wizard is to be
                listed. It also determines the order of the categories.

        \row
            \li QString
            \li displayCategory
        \li Description of the category.
    \endtable

    All wizards that have the same category set will be grouped together in the
    \uicontrol {New File or Project} dialog.
