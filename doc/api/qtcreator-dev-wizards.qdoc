    \title Creating Wizards in Code

    \section1 Introduction

    If the functionality provided by template-based
    \l{http://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator-snapshot/creator-project-wizards.html}{custom wizards}
    is not sufficient for your case, you can write wizards in code.

    A wizard in Qt Creator is an instance of a class implementing
    the Core::IWizard interface that is registered with ExtensionSystem::PluginManager.

    Implementing wizards requires:
    \list
    \o Deciding on a base class:
       \list
       \o Core::IWizard is a very generic interface that does
          not make any assumption about what the wizard does and
          what its UI looks like.

       \o Core::BaseFileWizard should be used for wizards that
          generate files using a UI based on Utils::Wizard.
       \endlist

    \o Providing a set of parameters that determine how the wizard shows up
       in the list of wizards in the  \gui{New File or Project} dialog.

       When deriving from Core::IWizard, virtual functions returning the
       values have to be implemented.

       When deriving from Core::BaseFileWizard, a parameter class
       Core::BaseFileWizardParameters needs to be passed to the constructor,
       on which the parameters can be set. This allows for easy creation
       of several wizard instances with slightly different parameters.

    \o Implementing the wizard UI

       Typically, this will be a class derived from Utils::Wizard.
       Utils::Wizard extends QWizard with the functionality to show a progress
       bar on the left.

    \o Implementing the wizard functionality

       When deriving from Core::BaseFileWizard, a list of Core::GeneratedFile
       needs to be populated with the files and their contents.
       \note The files are not actually written to the disk. This will be
       done by Core::BaseFileWizard after performing overwrite checks and prompting
       the user accordingly.

    \endlist

    \section1 Example

    \section2 Introduction

    In this example, we create a wizard
    for writing HTML files consisting of a title and a paragraph,
    making use of QXmlStreamWriter.

    For the UI, we use Utils::FileWizardDialog and extend it by a page
    letting the user enter title and contents.

    In our BaseFileWizard implementation, we create the file contents
    using QXmlStreamWriter.

    \section2 The WebContentPageWizardPage Class

    Let us start with the wizard page. We use a QLineEdit for the title
    and a QPlainTextEdit for the content, arranged in a QGridLayout with
    descriptive labels.
    \note The QGridLayout was chosen to be able to accommodate the large
    vertical span of the QPlainTextEdit. For standard controls, a
    QFormLayout should be considered, which will lay out the labels
    according to the platform guide lines.

    On top of that, we implement validation logic to ensure content is entered.
    We implement QWizardPage::isComplete() to return true when both input widgets
    have contents, enabling the \gui{Next} button. For this to happen
    as the user enters text, we need to connect to the changed() signal of the
    controls and emit QWizardPage::completeChanged() once the complete status changes.

    \section2 The WebContentWizardDialog Class

    The wizard dialog extends Utils::FileWizardDialog, which presents an
    introductory page asking for file name and path.
    We add our WebContentPageWizardPage after that.

    \snippet webpagewizard/webpagewizard.h 2

    \snippet webpagewizard/webpagewizard.cpp 2

    \section2 The WebContentWizard Class

    In our implementation of Core::BaseFileWizard, we overwrite
    createWizardDialog() to return an instance of our WebContentWizardDialog,
    initially set to the path passed in. We also add the extension pages
    we receive. Extension pages are for example the wizard pages asking for
    a project to add the files to and whether to add the files to a version control
    system.

    In generateFiles(), we obtain the parameters from our wizard and populate
    the list of Core::GeneratedFile with our file. To generate the contents,
    we use QXmlStreamWriter.

    \section2 Plugin Registration

    In order for the wizard to be found by the \gui{New} dialog, we need to
    register it with ExtensionSystem::PluginManager, which also takes care
    of deleting it:

    \snippet webpagewizard/webpagewizardplugin.cpp 0

    \section2 Complete Example Code

    Here is the complete code of \c webpagewizard.h:
    \snippet webpagewizard/webpagewizard.h 0
    The complete code of \c webpagewizard.cpp looks as follows:
    \snippet webpagewizard/webpagewizard.cpp 0

    The registration of the wizard in the \c initialize() method
    of a plugin looks like:
