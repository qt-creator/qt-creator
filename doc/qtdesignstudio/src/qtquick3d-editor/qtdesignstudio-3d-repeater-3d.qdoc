    \title Repeater3D

    The \uicontrol Repeater3D component is used to create multiple
    similar items. Like other view types, \uicontrol Repeater3D needs a model
    and a delegate. The delegate sets the item to use and the model sets the
    structure of the items in the \uicontrol Repeater3D component.

    The model can be any of the supported \l{Qt QML Models QML Types}
    {data models}. Additionally, like delegates for other views, a delegate for
    the \uicontrol Repeater3D can access its index within the repeater, as well
    as the model data relevant to the delegate.

    \note \uicontrol Repeater3D owns all items it instantiates. Removing or
    dynamically destroying an item created by \uicontrol Repeater3D results in
    unpredictable behavior.

    \note \uicontrol Repeater3D can only repeat objects derived from
    \uicontrol Nodes.

    For more information, see \l{https://doc.qt.io/qt/qml-qtquick3d-repeater3d.html}
    {Repeater3D} in the \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} documentation.

    \section2 Repeater3D Properties

    \section3 Model

    The \uicontrol Model property specifies the model providing data for the
    repeater. You can only use the \uicontrol Model property in the
    \uicontrol Properties view to set a numeric model or to bind to QML based
    models. You can use the \l {Code} view to define any of the supported
    data models as the value of the \uicontrol Model property:
        \list
            \li A number that indicates the number of delegates to be created by
                the repeater.
            \li A model, such as a \uicontrol ListModel component, or a
                QAbstractItemModel subclass.
            \li A string list.
            \li An object list.
        \endlist

    The type of model affects the properties that are exposed to the delegate.

    \section3 Delegate

    The \uicontrol Delegate property specifies a template defining each object
    instantiated by the repeater. Currently, the \uicontrol Delegate property
    needs to be defined in code using the \uicontrol Edit mode or
    the \uicontrol {Code} view. Delegates are exposed to a read-only index
    property that indicates the index of the delegate within the repeater. For
    more information, see \l{https://doc.qt.io/qt/qml-qtquick3d-repeater3d.html#delegate-prop}
    {Delegate} in the \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} documentation.

    If the model is a model object, such as a ListModel, the delegate can access
    all model roles as named properties, in the same way that delegates do for
    view classes like \uicontrol ListView.

    \section1 Adding a Repeater3D Component with a Numeric Model

    This section explains how to add a \uicontrol Repeater3D component with
    a numeric model to your \QDS project.

    To add a \uicontrol Repeater3D component:

    \list 1
      \li Drag a \uicontrol Repeater3D component from \uicontrol Components to
      \e scene in \uicontrol Navigator.
      \li Select \e repeater3D in \uicontrol Navigator and in
      \uicontrol Properties, set \uicontrol Model to 4.
      \image repeater3d-model-property.png
    \endlist
    Now, you have set up the \uicontrol Repeater3D component to use a numeric
    model that draws four instances of the same item. Next, you need to add the
    item to draw. In this example we are using a \uicontrol Cube.
    \list 1
      \li From \uicontrol Components, drag a \uicontrol Cube to \e repeater3D in
      \uicontrol Navigator.
      Now, four cubes are drawn to the scene, but they are drawn to the exact same
      place.
      \li Select \e cube in \uicontrol Navigator and in \uicontrol Properties
      select \inlineimage icons/action-icon.png
      next to \uicontrol Translation > \uicontrol X.
      \li Select \uicontrol {Set binding} to open \uicontrol {Binding Editor}.
      \li In the binding editor, enter \c{index * 150}. This sets the X
      location to increase by 150 for each of the cube instances.
      \image repeater3d-index-binding.png
      \li Select \uicontrol OK and go to the \uicontrol{3D} view to see the
      result.
    \endlist

    \section1 Adding a Repeater3D Component with a Model

    This section explains how to add a \uicontrol Repeater3D component with
    a model to your \QDS project:

    To add a \uicontrol Repeater3D component:

    \list 1
      \li Drag a \uicontrol Repeater3D component from \uicontrol Components to
      \e scene in \uicontrol Navigator.
      \li Go to \uicontrol {Model Editor} and create a new model with the name
      \e planetModel.
      \li Add the following columns and data to the model.
        \raw HTML
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>name (<i>String</i>)</th>
            <th>radius (<i>Real</i>)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mars</td>
            <td>3.39</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Earth</td>
            <td>6.37</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Venus</td>
            <td>6.05</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        \endraw
        \note You can also import a model in JSON or CSV format. See \l {Importing a Data Model}.
        \image repeater3d-model-editor.webp
      \li In \uicontrol Navigator, select \e{_3DRepeater}.
      \li In \uicontrol Properties, set \uicontrol Model to \e {DataStore.planetModel}.
    \endlist
    Now, you have set up the \uicontrol Repeater3D component to use a
    \uicontrol ListModel to draw the items. Next, you need to add the
    item to draw. In this example, you are using a \uicontrol Sphere.

    \list 1
      \li From \uicontrol Components, drag a \uicontrol Sphere to \e _3DRepeater
      in \uicontrol Navigator.
      \image repeater3d-listmodel-navigator.png
      \li Select \e sphere in \uicontrol Navigator and in the \Properties view, select
      \inlineimage icons/action-icon.png
      next to \uicontrol Scale > \uicontrol X.
      \li Select \uicontrol {Set binding} to open \uicontrol {Binding Editor}.
      \li In the binding editor, enter \c{radius}. This sets the X
      scale to the radius value defined in the model for each of the sphere
      instances.
      \image repeater3d-radius-binding.png
      \li Select \uicontrol OK.
      \li Repeat steps 2 to 5 for \uicontrol Scale > \uicontrol Y and
      \uicontrol Scale > \uicontrol Z.
    \endlist

    Now, three spheres of different size are drawn but they are drawn in the same
    position so you need to change the position to see all spheres.

    \list 1
      \li Select \e sphere in \uicontrol Navigator and in the \uicontrol Properties view, select
      \inlineimage icons/action-icon.png
      next to \uicontrol Translation > \uicontrol X.
      \li Select \uicontrol {Set binding} to open \uicontrol {Binding Editor}.
      \li In the binding editor, enter \c{index * 1000}. This sets the X
      location to increase by 1000 for each of the sphere instances.
      \image repeater3d-location-binding.png
      \li Select \uicontrol OK and go to the \uicontrol{3D} view to see the
      result. You need to zoom out to see all the spheres.
    \endlist
