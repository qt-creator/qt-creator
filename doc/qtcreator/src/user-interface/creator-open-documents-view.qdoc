            prolonged inactivity. The files are still listed in the
            \uicontrol {Open Documents} view. Set the minimum number of files
            that should be kept in memory in the \uicontrol {Files to keep open}
            field.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Warn before opening text files greater than}
