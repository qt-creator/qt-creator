    \title Developing for MCUs

    \brief Connect MCU devices to the computer to run and debug applications on
    them.

    \note Enable the McuSupport plugin to develop for MCUs.

    Use subsets of QML and Qt Quick Controls to create user interfaces for
    devices that are powered by microcontroller units (MCU). \QMCU has a
    new graphics rendering engine with a low memory footprint and optimization
    for MCUs and other resource-constrained devices.

    Connect MCU boards to a computer to build applications for them. Deploy the
    applications on MCUs to run and debug them.

    For a list of \QMCU reference implementations, see
    \l{\QMCU - Supported Target Platforms}.

    \section1 Requirements

    To use \QC to develop QML applications for MCUs, you need the following:

    \list
        \li \QMCU SDK (only available for Windows and Linux)
        \li \l {\QMCU - Prerequisites}{Suitable toolchain}
    \endlist

    The toolchains are available for cross-compilation on Microsoft Windows,
    Linux, and macOS. However, the Qt for \QMCU SDK is currently only available
    for Windows and Linux.

    The hardware-specific requirements vary depending on the hardware platform you are developing for.
    For more information see:
    \list
        \li Getting Started on NXP
        \list
            \li \l {Getting started on NXP (BareMetal and FreeRTOS)}
            \li \l {Getting started on NXP (Linux)}
            \li \l {Getting started on NXP (Zephyr)}
        \endlist
        \li \l{Getting Started on STM}
        \li \l{Getting Started on Renesas}
        \li \l{Getting Started on Infineon}
     \endlist

    \section1 \QMCU SDKs

    While you can use the latest \QC version to develop with any \QMCU SDK, the
    following combinations have been tested to work well.

    \note Enable the McuSupport plugin to develop for MCUs.

    To configure a connection between \QC and your MCU board:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol SDKs > \uicontrol MCU.
        \li In \uicontrol {\QMCU SDK}, specify the path to the directory where
            you installed \QMCU SDK.

        \li In \uicontrol {Targets supported by the \QMCU SDK}, select your MCU
            board.
        \li In \uicontrol Requirements, check that the platform-specific
            requirements are met. This depends on the target:

    \title Add MCU devices

    \note Enable the McuSupport plugin to develop for MCUs.

    \QC automatically adds a default MCU device when you select
    \uicontrol Apply in \preferences > \uicontrol SDKs > \uicontrol MCU after
    adding an SDK.

    To add MCU devices, select \preferences > \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol Add
    > \uicontrol {MCU Device} > \uicontrol {Start Wizard}:

       \list 1
           \li In \uicontrol Name, give the device a name.
           \li In \uicontrol Type, select the board type.

    \title Manage MCU Kits

    \note Enable the McuSupport plugin to develop for MCUs.

    \QC automatically adds kits for all the available MCU targets if you select
    \uicontrol {Automatically create kits for all available targets on start}
    in \preferences > \uicontrol SDKs > \uicontrol MCU. This setting is selected
    by default.

    \image {qtcreator-mcu-new-kit.webp} {Automatically create MCU kits in the MCU tab in SDKs preferences}

    \note When you update the \QMCU SDK, \QC asks you whether you want to replace
    the existing kits or create additional kits. To do this manually for each
    target, select \uicontrol {Update Kit} or \uicontrol {Create Kit}.

    To add new kits, go to \preferences > \uicontrol SDKs > \uicontrol MCU,
    and select \uicontrol {Create Kit}. This adds the paths to the kit's toolkits
    and SDKs, and keeps them synchronized when you select \uicontrol Apply or
    \uicontrol OK.

    \section1 Change or remove MCU kits

    To change or remove individual kits, go to \preferences > \uicontrol Kits.

    \image {qtcreator-preferences-kits-mcu.webp} {MCU kit in the Kits tab in Kits preferences}

    The \uicontrol {MCU dependencies} field displays paths to 3rd party
    software required for MCU development with the current kit.

    \title Create MCU projects

    \note Enable the McuSupport plugin to develop for MCUs.

    Create a project for developing an application that you can run on MCUs.
    The project imports a subset of QML and Qt Quick Controls types
    that are supported by \QMCU. For more information about developing
    applications for MCUs, see \l {Qt for MCUs}.

    To create an application and run it on a MCU board:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New Project}.
            \image {qtcreator-mcu-new-project.webp} {New Project dialog}
        \li Select \uicontrol {QmlProject Application (\QMCU)} >
            \uicontrol {Qt for MCUs Empty Application} or
            \uicontrol {Qt for MCUs Example Application} > \uicontrol Choose.
        \li Follow the instructions of the wizard to create the project.
        \li Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Build & Run}, and then
            select the kit for building the application and running it on the
            MCU board specified in the kit.
        \li Go to \uicontrol {Run Settings} to specify run settings.
            Usually, you can use the default settings.
