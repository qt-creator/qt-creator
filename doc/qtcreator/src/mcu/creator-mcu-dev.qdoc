    \title Connecting MCUs

    Qt for MCU enables you to use subsets of QML and Qt Quick Controls
    to create user interfaces for devices that are powered by microcontroller
    units (MCU). It includes a new graphics rendering engine that has a low
    memory footprint and is optimized for MCUs and other resource-constrained
    devices.

    You can connect MCU boards to a development host to build applications for
    them using the GNU Arm Embedded GCC compiler, libraries, and other GNU tools
    necessary for bare metal software development on devices based on the Arm
    Cortex-M processors. You can deploy the applications on MCUs to run and
    debug them using \QC.

    The toolchains are available for cross-compilation on Microsoft Windows,
    Linux, and macOS. However, the Qt for MCU SDK is currently only available
    for Windows.

    The following MCU boards are currently supported:

    \list
        \li \l{https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f7508-dk.html}
            {STM32F7508-DK}
        \li \l{https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f769idiscovery.html}
            {STM32F769I-DISCO}
        \li \l{https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i.mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i.mx-rt1050-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT1050-EVK}
            {NXP i.MX RT1050 EVK}
    \endlist

    For a list of Qt for MCU reference implementations, see the Qt for MCU
    documentation.

    You use the \l{Connecting Bare Metal Devices}{Bare metal plugin} to connect
    to OpenOCD or ST-LINK Utility for debugging on MCUs.

    \endlist

    \section1 Running Applications on MCUs

    You can use a wizard to set up a project for developing an application that
    you can run on MCUs. The project uses a subset of QML and Qt Quick Controls
    that are supported by Qt for MCU. For more information about developing
    applications for MCUs, see the Qt for MCU documentation.

    To create an application and run it on a MCU board:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File or Project} >
            \uicontrol Application > \uicontrol {MCU Support Application} >
            \uicontrol Choose.
        \li Follow the instructions of the wizard to create the project.
        \li Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Build & Run}, and then
            select the kit for building the application and running it on the
            MCU board specified in the kit.
        \li Select \uicontrol Run to specify run settings.
            Usually, you can use the default settings.
