    \title Developing for Android

    \brief Set up the toolchain for building applications for Android devices.

    Install a Qt version targeting Android and the Android SDK and NDK to develop
    Qt applications for Android devices. To check the Android version supported
    by each Qt version, see the \l {Qt for Android} documentation for the Qt
    version.

    To get helpful code editing features for Java, such as code completion,
    highlighting, function tooltips, and navigating in code, add a
    \l{Add a Java language server}{Java language server}.

    \QC integrates the Android Debug Bridge (\c adb) command-line tool for
    deploying applications to Android devices, running them, and reading their
    logs. The \c adb tool includes a client and server that run on
    the computer and a daemon that runs on the Android emulator or device.

    \note \QC only detects a device and connects to it after you
    \l{Debug on Android Devices}{enable USB debugging on it}.

    The following video shows the whole process from installing Qt for Android
    to debugging an application on an Android device:

    \section1 Requirements

    To use \QC to develop Qt applications for Android, you need:

    \list
        \li \l {Qt for Android}
        \li \l {Android Development Prerequisites}{Android tools} that \QC can
            automatically download, install, and configure for you.

    \title Set up Android development environment

    \QC offers to automatically install all the necessary packages and tools and
    to set up your \l{Qt for Android} development environment by creating
    debuggers, toolchains, and kits.

    Use \QC to:

    \list
        \li Download and extract the Android SDK Command-line Tools.
        \li Install or update the essential packages such as NDKs,
            build tools, and platform tools.
    \endlist

    To set up the development environment for Android:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol SDKs > \uicontrol Android.
            \image qtcreator-preferences-android.webp {Android preferences}
        \li In \uicontrol {JDK location}, set the path to the JDK.
            \QC checks the JDK installation and reports errors.

            By default, \QC tries to find a supported \l{Adoptium OpenJDK} or
            \l{OpenJDK} installation. If it cannot find one, you must set the
            path manually. If you have not installed a supported JDK, select
            \inlineimage icons/online.png
            to open the JDK download web page in the default browser.

            \note Use a 64-bit JDK because the 32-bit one might cause issues with
            \c cmdline-tools, and some packages might not appear in the list.
        \li In \uicontrol {Android SDK location}, set the path to the
            folder to install the \l{Android SDK Command-line Tools}.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Set Up SDK} to automatically download and extract
            the Android SDK Command-line Tools to the selected path.

            SDK Manager checks that you have the necessary tools. If you need
            more packages or updates, SDK Manager offers to add or remove
            the appropriate packages. Before taking action, it prompts you to
            accept the changes. In addition, it prompts you to accept Google
            licenses, as necessary.
        \li \uicontrol {Android NDK list} lists the installed NDK versions.
            SDK Manager installed the locked items. You can modify them only
            from the \uicontrol {Android SDK Manager} dialog. For more
            information, see \l{Manage Android NDK Packages}.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Automatically create kits for Android tool chains}
            to automatically create the necessary kits. \QC displays a
            warning if it cannot find a suitable Qt version.
        \li Optionally, in \uicontrol {Android OpenSSL Settings} group, set
            the path to the prebuilt OpenSSL libraries.

            For Qt applications that require OpenSSL support, add
            \l {Android OpenSSL support} to your project, as instructed in
            \l{Adding External Libraries}.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Download OpenSSL} to download the OpenSSL
            repository to the selected path. If the automatic download fails,
            the download web page opens for manual download.
    \endlist

    \section1 Manual setup

    If the automatic setup does not meet your needs, download
    and install Android SDK Command-line Tools, and then install or update the
    necessary NDKs, tools, and packages. For more information, see
    \l{Getting Started with Qt for Android}.

    \section1 View Android toolchain settings

    A JSON configuration file defines the Android SDK Command-Line Tools download
    URL, the essential packages list, and the appropriate NDK for each Qt version.
    The file is in the \QC resource folder:

    \badcode
    # Linux and macOS
    ~/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/android/sdk_definitions.json

    # Windows
    C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\QtProject\qtcreator\android\sdk_definitions.json
    \endcode

    For example, the SDK configuration file sets the NDK version 22.1.7171670
    for use with Qt 6.3, Qt 6.2, and Qt 5.15.9 to 5.15.20:

    \badcode
    "specific_qt_versions": [
    {       "versions": ["6.3", "6.2", "5.15.[9-20]"],
            "sdk_essential_packages": ["build-tools;31.0.0", "ndk;22.1.7171670"]
        },
    ]
    \endcode

    You can view the latest version of the configuration file that is up-to-date
    with the Android SDK and NDK changes, \l{sdk_definitions.json}, in Git.

    \note For Qt 6.5 or later, \QC reads the NDK version that was used for
    building Qt from \c modules/Core.json and uses it instead of the version
    in \c sdk_definitions.json.
