    \title Converting UI Projects to Applications

    Qt Quick UI projects are useful for creating user interfaces. To
    use them for application development in Qt Creator you have to add:

    \list
        \li Project configuration file (.pro)
        \li C++ code (.cpp)
        \li Resource files (.qrc)
        \li Code needed for deploying applications to \l{glossary-device}
            {devices}
    \endlist

    You can use a Qt Creator wizard to create a Qt Quick application that is
    built using the qmake build system and then copy the source files from the
    Qt UI Quick project to the application project.

    You can use the \c RESOURCES option in the project configuration file to
    automatically add all the QML files and related assets to a Qt resource
    file.

    The wizard automatically adds the \c QML_IMPORT_PATH option to the project
    file for specifying the required
    \l{https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-syntax-imports.html#qml-import-path}
    {QML import path}. The path is only needed if more than one subdirectory
    contains QML files.

    Then you can use the \l QQuickView class in the main C++ source file to
    show the main QML file when the application starts.

    The \l{Qt Quick Timeline} module is delivered with \QDS and with Qt 5.14,
    and later. If you use a timeline in a \QDS project that you import to \QC,
    and your Qt is older than 5.14, you must build the Qt Quick Timeline module
    and install it to your Qt to be able to build your project.

    \section1 Converting Projects

    To convert a project that has a .qmlproject file to one that has a .pro
    file:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File or Project} >
            \uicontrol {Application (Qt Quick)} >
            \uicontrol {Qt Quick Application - Empty} > \uicontrol Choose.
        \li In the \uicontrol {Build system} field, select \l qmake as the build
            system to use for building and running the project, and then select
            \uicontrol Next (or \uicontrol Continue on \macos).
        \li Follow the instructions of the wizard to create the project.
        \li In the file explorer, copy the source files from the Qt Quick UI
            project directory to a subdirectory in the application
            project directory. For the purpose of these instructions, the
            directory is called \c qml.
        \li Open the application project file, and edit the value of the
            \c RESOURCES option to add the following line:
            \badcode
            RESOURCES += \
                $$files(qml/*)
            \endcode
        \li Also edit the value of the \c QML_IMPORT_PATH option to specify the
            QML import path:
            \badcode
            QML_IMPORT_PATH = qml/imports
            \endcode
            Where \c {qml/imports} is the import path.
        \li Select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Run qmake} to apply the
            \c RESOURCES option to the build configuration.
        \li Open the \e {main.cpp} file and replace the QQmlApplicationEngine
            object with a QQuickView object:
            \quotefromfile progressbar/main.cpp
            \skipto QQuickView view;
            \printuntil view.show()
            Where \c {qrc:/qml/imports} is the import path and
            \c {qrc:/qml/ProgressBar.ui.qml} is the path to and the
            name of the main QML file in the Qt Quick UI project.
        \li Select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol Run to build and run your
            project.
    \endlist

    For example, if you copy the source files of the \e ProgressBar
    example from your \QDS installation (located in the
    \c{\share\qtcreator\examples\ProgressBar} directory) to an empty
    Qt Quick application project and make the necessary changes, the
    \e {main.cpp} file should look as follows:

    \quotefile progressbar/main.cpp

    \section1 Adding Custom Fonts

    To \l{Using Custom Fonts}{use custom fonts} from the Qt Quick UI project,
    call the QFontDatabase::addApplicationFont() function from the \e {main.cpp}
    file.

    \section1 Adding Qt Quick Timeline Module to Qt Installations

    \note You only need to do this if your Qt version is older than 5.14.

    Check out the \l{Qt Quick Timeline} module from
    \l{https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/admin/projects/qt/qtquicktimeline}
    {Qt Code Review}.

    For example:
    \badcode
    git clone ssh://user@codereview.qt-project.org:29418/qt/qtquicktimeline
    \endcode

    Then use qmake from your Qt installation to build the module and to add it
    to your Qt. Switch to the directory that contains the sources (usually,
    \c qtquicktimeline), and enter the following commands:

    \badcode
    <path_to_qmake>\qmake -r
    make
    make install
    \endcode

    On Windows, use the \c nmake and \c {nmake install} commands instead.
