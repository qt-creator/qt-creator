    \title Developing for Bare Metal Devices

    \brief Create kits to use Bare Metal toolchains installed on the computer
    to build applications for and run and debug them on connected Bare Metal
    devices.

    Run and debug applications on small devices that are not supported
    by the remote Linux device plugin by using GDB or a hardware debugger.

    \note Enable the Bare Metal plugin to use it.

    Install Bare Metal toolchains on the computer to build applications for
    Bare Metal devices. Connect the devices to the computer to run and debug
    applications on them.

    \note If you use qmake to build the project and the device does not have
    Qt libraries, you need a Qt installation that meets the requirements in
    \l{Self-built Qt versions}. In addition, the \c mkspecs directory needs
    to be complete enough to parse .pro files.

    The following toolchains are supported for building applications:

    \list
        \li GCC: Microchip Technology (AVR, AVR32, PIC16, PIC32),
            NXP Semiconductors (ColdFire, M68K), Texas Instruments (MSP430),
            National Semiconductor (CR16C), Renesas Electronics (M32R, M32C,
            RL78, RX, SuperH, V850), Tensilica XTENSA (ESP8266, ESP32), RISC-V,
            Arm
        \li \l{https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/}{IAR EW}:
            Microchip Technology (AVR, AVR32), NXP Semiconductors
            (ColdFire, M68K), Texas Instruments (MSP430),
            National Semiconductor (CR16C), Renesas Electronics (78K,
            M16/R8C, M32C, R32C, RH850, RL78, RX, SuperH, V850),
            STMicroelectronics (STM8), 8051, RISC-V, Arm
        \li \l{https://www.keil.com/product/}{Keil}: Arm, C51 (8051),
            C251 (80251), C166 (C16x, XC16x)
        \li \l{http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/}{SDCC}: STMicroelectronics (STM8),
            8051
    \endlist

    The bare metal device type accepts custom GDB commands that you specify in
    the device preferences. You can specify the commands to execute when connecting
    using a particular debug server provider.

    \section1 Debug Server Providers

    The following debug server providers are supported when using GDB:

    \list
        \li \l {Set up EBlink}{EBlink}
        \li \l {Set up J-Link}{J-Link}
        \li \l {Set up OpenOCD}{OpenOCD}
        \li \l {Set up ST-Link}{ST-Link}
    \endlist

    ST-Link and J-Link debug server providers can be used together with
    the \l {Set up the uVision IDE}{uVision IDE}.

    To create connections to bare metal devices using a debug server provider,
    go to \preferences > \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol {Bare Metal} and select
    \uicontrol Add.

    The available settings depend on the debug server provider.
