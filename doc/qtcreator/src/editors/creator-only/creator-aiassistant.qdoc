    \title Use Qt AI Assistant

    Qt AI Assistant is a coding assistant. When connected to a Large Language
    Model (LLM), it auto-completes your code, gives expert coding advice,
    suggests code fixes, as well as writes test cases and code documentation.

    \image {qtaiassistant-codecompletion.webp} {Automatic Code Completion}

    Qt AI Assistant is available for selected commercial Qt developer
    license holders. For more information on licensing, select \uicontrol Compare
    in \l{Qt pricing}.

    \note The LLM itself is not in scope of the Qt AI Assistant. You need to
    connect to a third-party LLM and agree to the terms and conditions, as well
    as to the acceptable use policy of the LLM provider. By using Qt AI Assistant,
    you agree to \l{Terms & Conditions - Qt Development Framework}.

    Qt AI Assistant is currently experimental and powered by generative AI. Check
    all suggestions to make sure that they are fit for use in your project.

    \note Install and load the Qt AI Assistant extension to use it.

        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol {AI Assistant} > \uicontrol General.
            \image {qtcreator-preferences-qtaiassistant-general.webp} {General tab in AI Assistant preferences}
        \li Select an LLM for each configurable use case.
        \li Go to \uicontrol Advanced.
            \image {qtcreator-preferences-qtaiassistant-advanced.webp} {Advanced tab in AI Assistant preferences}
        \li Enter the API authentication token and server URL of each LLM.
            For more information on where to get the access information, see the
            third-party LLM provider documentation.
    \endlist

    \section1 Automatic code-completion

    Qt AI Assistant can help you write code by suggesting what to write next.
    It prompts the LLM to make one code suggestion when you stop typing.

    To accept the entire suggestion, select the \key Tab key.

    To accept parts of the suggestions, select \key {Alt+Right}.

    To dismiss the suggestion, select \key Esc or navigate to another position in
    the code editor.

    To interact with Qt AI Assistant using the mouse, hover over the suggestion.

    \image {qtaiassistant-codecompletionbar.webp} {Code completion tool bar when hovering over a suggestion}

    When you hover over a suggestion, you can accept parts of the suggested code
    snippet word-by-word or line-by-line.

    To close the code completion bar, select the \key Esc key or move the cursor
    to another position.

    To select the model for code completion, go to \preferences >
    \uicontrol {AI Assistant} > \uicontrol General.

    In \uicontrol General, you can also turn auto-completion of code on or off
    globally for all projects. Qt AI Assistant consumes a significant number of
    tokens from the LLM. To cut costs, turn off the auto-completion feature when
    not needed, and use keyboard shortcuts for code completion.

    \section1 Complete code from the keyboard

    To trigger code suggestions manually, select \key {Ctrl+'}.

    \section1 Enter prompts and smart commands

    In an inline prompt window in the text editor, you can prompt the assistant
    to implement your requests in human language, ask questions, or execute
    \e {smart commands}. To open the chat, select \key {Ctrl+Shift+A}.
    Alternatively, to open the inline prompt window, you can select code
    and then select \inlineimage {icons/ai-assistant.png} {AI Assistant}.

    To close the inline prompt window, select \key Esc or
    \inlineimage {icons/close.png} {Close}.

    To go to Qt AI Assistant preferences from the inline prompt window, select
    \inlineimage {icons/settings.png} {Preferences}. There, you can set the model
    to use for prompts and code reviews.

    \section2 Request suggestions using human language

    To request suggestions using human language, enter your requests into the
    input field. If you have highlighted code, the AI assistant adds it as
    context to the prompt. Qt AI Assistant shows a suggestion that you can
    copy to the clipboard by selecting \uicontrol Copy in the inline prompt
    window.

    \section2 Request code review

    To review code with Qt AI Assistant:

    \list 1
        \li Highlight code in the code editor.
        \li Open the inline prompt window.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {/review} smart command.
    \endlist

    Qt AI Assistant reviews the code and suggests improvements. It uses
    \l {qmllint}{QML Lint} to review QML code if \uicontrol {Enable QML linter}
    is on in \preferences > \uicontrol {AI Assistant} > \uicontrol General.

    \section2 Request test cases in Qt Test syntax
