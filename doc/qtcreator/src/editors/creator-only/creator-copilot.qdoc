    \title Using GitHub Copilot

    The Copilot plugin (disabled by default) integrates
    \l{https://github.com/features/copilot}{GitHub Copilot} into \QC.
    You can view suggestions from Copilot in the \uicontrol Edit mode.

    \note If you enable the Copilot plugin, you must agree with and abide by
    the GitHub terms of use. It is your responsibility to know and accept the
    requirements and parameters of using Copilot, such as ensuring you have
    the rights to grant it access to your code. Also, you must understand the
    implications of using it and the suggestions it produces, such as code
    copyright and accuracy.

    \section1 Receiving Suggestions

    When you write code in the \l {Working in Edit Mode}{Edit} mode and
    \uicontrol {Request completions automatically} is enabled, Copilot
    automatically makes suggestions when you type.

    To manually request a suggestion at the current editor's cursor position,
    select \uicontrol {Request Copilot Suggestion} in the context menu.

    Hover the mouse over a suggestion to show a toolbar with
    \inlineimage icons/prev.png
    and \inlineimage icons/next.png
    buttons for cycling between Copilot suggestions.

    To apply a suggestion as a whole, select \uicontrol Apply or press
    the \key Tab key.

    projects or at project level for a particular project.

    To enable or disable Copilot suggestions globally, select the
    \inlineimage icons/copilot.png
    (\uicontrol {Toggle Copilot}) button. This also sets the value of the
    \uicontrol {Enable Copilot} check box in \preferences accordingly.

    select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Project Settings} >
