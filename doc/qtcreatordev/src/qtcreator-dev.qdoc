    \title Extending Qt Creator Manual

    \QC is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) tailored to
    the needs of Qt developers.

    \QC is extensible in various ways. For example, \QC architecture is based on
    a plugin loader, which means that all functionality beyond plugin loading
    is implemented in plugins. However, you can extend and tweak many parts of
    \QC without the need to resort to coding in C++ and implementing such a
    plugin.

    This document gives you an overview of the various ways in which you can
    extend \QC, depending on what you want to achieve, and points you to the
    relevant documentation.

    \section1 Generating Domain Specific Code and Templates

    If you regularly need to write the same code, be it little code snippets,
    whole files or classes spread over multiple files, or complete projects, you
    can create code snippets, templates, and wizards for that purpose.

    \section2 Snippets

    Typically, snippets consist of a few lines of code (although they can also
    be plain text) that you regularly want to insert into a bigger body of code,
    but do not want to type each time. For example, \c while and \c for loops,
    \c if-else and \c try-catch constructs, and class skeletons. Snippets are
    triggered in the same way as normal code completion (see
    \l{Code Assist}{Providing Code Assist}).
    \QC contains a set of preconfigured snippets groups to which you can add
    your own snippets.

            {Snippets User Interface}
        \li \l{Snippets}{Adding Snippets Groups}
    \endlist

    \section2 File and Project Templates

    You can extend the wizards in \uicontrol File >
    \uicontrol {New File or Project} with your own file and project templates by
    writing JSON definition files for them.
    \list
        \li \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-wizards.html}
            {Adding New Custom Wizards}
        \li \l{User Interface Text Guidelines}
    \endlist

    \section2 Custom Wizards

    If the above methods for code snippets and templates are not sufficient for
    your use case, you can create a custom \QC plugin. While this gives you
    complete control over the wizard, it also requires you to write most of the
    UI and the logic yourself.

        \li \l{Qt Creator Coding Rules}
        \li \l{Creating Wizards in Code}
        \li \l{User Interface Text Guidelines}
    \endlist

    \section1 Supporting Additional File Types

    If you have files with extensions or MIME types that \QC does not handle by
    default, you can edit the MIME type definitions, add highlight definition
    files, and create your own text editors.

    \section2 MIME Types

    You might find that \QC could handle a particular file of yours if it knew
    about the type of its contents. For example, C++ header or source files
    with file extensions that are not known to \QC. You can adapt the MIME type
    definitions in \QC to your specific setup, by adding or removing file
    extensions and specifying magic headers.

    \list
        \li \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-mime-types.html}
            {Editing MIME Types}
        \li \l{http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-latest.html}
            {MIME Type Specification Files}
    \endlist

    \section2 Text Highlighting and Indentation

    For text files, \QC provides an easy way to add highlighting and indentation
    for file types that are not known to it by default. Generic highlighting is
    based on highlight definition files that are provided by the Kate Editor.
    You can download highlight definition files for use with \QC and create
    your own definition files.

    \list
        \li \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-editor-options.html#generic-highlighting}
            {Generic Highlighting}
        \li \l{http://kate-editor.org/2005/03/24/writing-a-syntax-highlighting-file/}
            {Writing a Syntax Highlighting File}
    \endlist

    \section2 Custom Text Editors

    If you need more advanced features than the MIME type and highlighting
    features described above, such as custom text completion or features that
    rely on semantic analysis, you can extend \QC with a text editor of your
    own. \QC provides a special API for text editors that gives you a basis to
    build on, taking away some of the pain of implementing a text editor from
    the ground up.

        \li \l{Text Editors}
        \li \l{CodeAssist} {Providing Code Assist}
    \endlist

    \section2 Other Custom Editors

    You can also add a completely custom editor to gain complete control over
    its appearance and behavior.

        \li \l{Qt Creator Coding Rules}

    \endlist

    \section1 Running External Tools

    Most software projects and development processes require various external
    tools. Several external tools, such as popular version control systems and
    build tool chains are integrated into \QC. However, it is impossible for a
    single tool to cover all the use cases, and therefore you can integrate
    additional tools to \QC.

    \section2 Simple External Tools

    In \QC, you can specify tools that you can then run from a menu or by using
    a keyboard shortcut that you assign. This allows you to accomplish several
    things, with some limitations. You specify a command to run, arguments and
    input for running it, and how to handle the output. To specify the values,
    you can use a set of internal \QC variables, such as the file name of the
    current document or project, or the currently selected text in a text
    editor. If you find variables missing, please do not hesitate to fill a
    feature suggestion. The tool descriptions are saved as XML files that you
    can share.

    \list
        \li \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-editor-external.html}
            {Using External Tools}
        \li \l{External Tool Specification Files}
    \endlist

    \section2 Complex External Tools

    When you plan to integrate more complex tools, carefully consider whether
    there really are advantages to be gained by tightly integrating the tool
    into \QC over loosely integrating it by mainly providing a means of starting
    the tool with fitting parameters.

    \section3 Loosely Integrating Tools

    If no interaction is needed between \QC and the external tool, just starting
    an external application with its own user interface is preferable. That way
    cluttering the \QC UI is avoided, and the tool will be available with a
    nice interface even without using \QC at all.

    Usually, you can use the external tool specification files to start the
    tool. If starting the tool and handling its output require more complex
    logic, you can add a menu item to \QC with a plugin. If you need a way to
    configure the tool in \QC, you can add an \uicontrol Options page for it.

    \list
        \li \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-editor-external.html}{Using External Tools}
        \li \l{External Tool Specification Files}
        \li \l{Creating Plugins}
        \li \l{Qt Creator Coding Rules}
        \li \l{Menus and Menu Items}
        \li \l{Options Pages}
    \endlist

    \section3 Interacting with Tool Output

    In some cases, running an external tool would not require tight integration
    with \QC, but investigating the output of the tool would benefit from it.
    For example, some tools generate lists of issues in files that are part of
    the project and some tools create output that is related to the code. For
    these tools, it is useful to interactively switch between the output and
    the corresponding code.

    One way to handle that would be to let the tool create an output file, which
    is then opened within \QC. You provide an editor (probably read-only) for
    handling this file. For lists of issues, consider creating task list files
    which are shown in the \uicontrol Issues output pane.

        \li \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-task-lists.html}
