  \title Introducing Qt Creator

  Qt Creator provides you with tools to design and develop animated applications for
  mobile devices and to develop complex applications for multiple desktop
  platforms.

  \section1 Developing for Mobile Devices

  \QMLD allows you to easily develop animations by using a declarative programming
  language called QML. You use a visual editor to create widgets and define changes
  in their state. \QMLD generates the necessary code for you.
  You can edit the code in the code editor to add transitions and interaction. You
  can write JavaScript to implement the application logic.

  \section1 Developing for Desktop Platforms

  As an IDE, Qt Creator differs from a text editor in that it knows how to build and run
  applications. It understands the code as code, not just as plain text. This allows
  it to:
  \list
      \o Enable you to write well formatted code
      \o Anticipate what you are going to write and complete the code
      \o Display inline error and warning messages
      \o Enable you to semantically navigate to classes, functions, and symbols
      \o Provide you with context-sensitive help on classes, functions, and symbols
      \o Rename symbols in an intelligent way, so that other symbols with the same name
         that belong to other scopes are not renamed
      \o Show you the locations in code where a function is declared or called
   \endlist

      \section1 Why Do You Need Projects?

      To be able to build and run applications, Qt Creator needs the same
      information as a compiler would need. This information is specified in the
      project build and run settings.

      Creating a project allows you to:
      \list
      \o Group files together
      \o Add custom build steps
      \o Include forms and resource files
      \o Specify settings for running applications
      \endlist

      You can either create a project from scratch or import an existing
      project. Qt Creator generates all the necessary files, depending on the type of
      project you create. For example, if you choose to create a graphical user
      interface (GUI) application, Qt Creator generates an empty .ui file
      that you can modify with the integrated \QD.

      If you choose to create a QML application, Qt Creator generates a .qml file
      that you can modify with the \QMLD visual editor and the code editor.

    \title Quick Tour

    The figure below shows some of the components of Qt Creator in
    \gui{Edit} mode.

    \image qtcreator-breakdown.png

    \section1 Qt Creator Modes

    The mode selector allows you to quickly switch between tasks such as
    editing project and source files, designing application UIs,
    configuring how projects are built and
    executed, and debugging your applications. To change modes, click the
    icons, or use the \l{keyboard-shortcuts}{corresponding keyboard shortcut}.

    \list
        \o \gui Welcome mode for opening recent sessions and projects.
        \o \gui{\l{Using the Editor}{Edit}} mode for editing project and source files.
        \o \gui{\l{Implementing Application UI}{Design}} mode for designing and developing animated applications for
        mobile devices.
        \o \gui{\l{Debugging}{Debug}} mode for inspecting the state of your program while
           debugging.
        \o \gui{\l{Managing Projects}{Projects}} mode for configuring project building and
           execution.
        \o \gui{\l{Getting Help}{Help}} mode for viewing Qt documentation.
    \endlist

    Certain actions in Qt Creator trigger a mode change. For example,
    \gui {Debug} > \gui {Start Debugging} > \gui {Start Debugging}
    automatically switches to \gui {Debug} mode.


    \section1 Browsing Project Contents

    Use the sidebar to browse files, projects and bookmarks.
    \image qtcreator-sidebar.png

    You can select the content of the sidebar in the sidebar menu:
    \list
        \o \gui Projects shows a list of projects open in the current
           session.
        \o \gui{File System} shows the content of the currently selected
           directory.
        \o \gui Bookmarks shows all bookmarks for the current session.
        \o \gui{Open Documents} shows currently open files.
    \endlist

    You can change the view of the sidebar in the following ways:
    \list
        \o To toggle the sidebar, click \inlineimage qtcreator-togglebutton.png
           or press \key Alt+0 (\key Cmd+0 on Mac OS X).
        \o To split the sidebar, click \inlineimage qtcreator-splitbar.png
           . Select new content to view in the split view.
        \o To close a sidebar view, click
           \inlineimage qtcreator-closesidebar.png
           .
    \endlist


    \section2 Viewing Project Files

    When the sidebar shows projects, they are displayed in a project tree. The
    project tree contains a list of all projects open in the current session.
    The files for each project are grouped according to their file type.

    You can use the project tree in the following ways:
    \list
        \o Double-click a file to open it in an editor.
        \o Right-click an item in the project tree to bring up a
           context menu containing the actions most commonly needed.
           For example, through the menu of the project root directory you can,
           build, re-build, clean and run the project.
        \o To list all files in a project, click
           \inlineimage qtcreator-filter.png
           and select \gui{Simplify Tree}.
        \o During a build, the build system automatically generates source
           files. To hide these files, click \inlineimage qtcreator-filter.png
           and select \gui{Hide Generated Files}.
        \o To toggle the synchronization of your project tree with the file
           opened in the editor, click
           \inlineimage qtcreator-synchronizefocus.png
           .
        \o To see the absolute path of a file, move the mouse pointer over the
           file name.
    \endlist


    \section1 Viewing Output

    The task pane in Qt Creator can display one of the following panes:
    \gui{Build Issues}, \gui{Search Results}, \gui{Application Output}, and
    \gui{Compile Output}. Output panes are available in all
    \l{Qt Creator Modes}{modes}.


    \section2 Build Issues

    The \gui{Build Issues} pane provides a list of errors and warnings
    encoutered during a build. The pane filters out irrelevant output from
    the build tools and presents the issues in an organized way.

    \image qtcreator-build-issues.png


    \section2 Search Results

    The \gui{Search Results} pane displays the results for global searches
    such as searching within a current document, files on disk, or all
    projects. The figure below shows an example output of search result for all
    occurrences of \c textfinder within the \c "/TextFinder" directory.

    \image qtcreator-search-pane.png


    \section2 Application Output

    The \gui{Application Output} pane displays the status of a program when
    it is executed, and the debug output. The figure below shows an example
    output from qDebug().

    \image qtcreator-application-output.png


    \section2 Compile Output

    The \gui{Compile Output} pane provides all output from the compiler. In
    other words, it is a more detailed version of information displayed in the
    \gui{Build Issues} pane.

    \image qtcreator-compile-pane.png


    \section1 Getting Help

    Qt Creator comes fully integrated with Qt documentation and
    examples using the Qt Help plugin. You can get help in the following
    ways:

    \list

    \o To view documentation, switch to \gui Help mode.

    \o To get context sensitive help, move the text cursor to a Qt class or
    function and press \key F1. The documentation is displayed in a pane
    next to the code editor, or, if there is not enough vertical space, in the
    fullscreen \gui Help mode.

    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-context-sensitive-help.png

    To select and configure how the documentation is displayed in the
    \gui Help mode, select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Help.

    \section2 Adding External Documentation

    You can display external documentation in the Qt Creator \gui Help mode.
    To augument or replace the documentation that ships with Qt Creator and Qt:
    \list 1
        \o Create a .qch file from your documentation.

           For information on how to prepare your documentation and create a
           .qch file, see
           \l {http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qthelp-framework.html}{The Qt Help Framework}.
        \o Add the .qch file to Qt Creator by selecting \gui Tools >
           \gui Options > \gui Help > \gui Documentation > \gui Add.
    \endlist


    \section1 Navigating with Keyboard

    Qt Creator caters not only to developers who are used to using the mouse,
    but also to developers who are more comfortable with the keyboard. A wide
    range of \l{keyboard-shortcuts}{keyboard} and
    \l{Searching With the Locator}{navigation} shortcuts are available to help
    speed up the process of developing your application.

    \section1 Developing Application UI

    To help you design the user interface of your application, two visual
    editors are integrated into Qt Creator:

    \list
    \o \QD
    \o \QMLD
    \endlist

    The integration includes project management and code completion.

    \section1 Using Qt Designer

    Qt Creator automatically opens all .ui files in \QD.

    \image qtcreator-formedit.png

    To change the layout of \QD user interface elements:
    \list 1
        \o Select \gui Tools > \gui{Form Editor} > \gui Views >
           \gui Locked.

           When this option is unchecked, you can change the layout.
        \o Click the header of an element and drag the element to a new
           position.
    \endlist

    To change \QD properties, select \gui Tools > \gui Options >
    \gui Designer.
    \list
        \o Set the class properties and code generation preferences in \gui
           {Class Generation}.
        \o Set an additional folder for saving templates in \gui{Template
           Paths}.
        \o Set the grid settings and preview preferences in \gui Forms. To
           preview your form with skins, enable \gui{Print/Preview
           Configuration} and select your skin. Otherwise default preview
           settings are used.

           To preview the settings, select \gui Tools > \gui{Form Editor} >
           \gui Preview, or press \key Ctrl+Alt+R.
        \o To specify embedded device profiles, such as style, font, and screen
           resolution, select \gui{Embedded Design}.
    \endlist

    For more information on \QD, see
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/designer-manual.html}{Qt Designer Manual}.

    \section1 Using QML Designer

    You can edit .qml files in either the visual \QMLD editor or in the
    code editor.

    In \gui Projects, double-click a .gml file to open it in the code
    editor. Then select the \gui {Design} mode to edit the file in the
    visual editor.

    \image qmldesigner-visual-editor.png "Visual editor"

    \nextpage creator-editor-finding.html

    \title Using the Editor

    Qt Creator's code editor is designed to aid you in creating, editing and
    navigating code. It is fully equipped with syntax checking, code
    completion, context sensitive help and in-line error indicators while you
    are typing.


    \section1 Configuring the Editor

    Qt Creator allows you to configure the text editor to suit your specific
    needs. To configure the editor, select  \gui Tools > \gui Options >
    \gui{Text Editor}:
    \list
        \o Set the font preferences and apply syntax highlighting in
           \gui{Font & Colors}.
        \o Set tabs, indentation and the handling of whitespace in
           \gui Behavior.
        \o Set various display properties, such as
           \l{Highlighting and Folding Blocks}{highlighting and folding blocks},
           text wrapping or \l{Moving to Symbol Definition or Declaration}
           {moving to symbol definition or declaration}
           in \gui Display.
        \o Enable \l{Code Completion}{code completion} in \gui Completion.
    \endlist


    \section1 Using the Editor Toolbar

    The editor toolbar is located at the top of the editor view. It is context
    sensitive and shows items relevant to the file currently open in the
    editor.

    \image qtcreator-editortoolbar-symbols.png

    Use the toolbar to navigate between open files and symbols in use:
    \list
        \o To browse the history of edits for the currently open session, click
           \inlineimage qtcreator-back.png
           and \inlineimage qtcreator-forward.png
           .
        \o To go to any open file, select it from the \gui{Open files}
           drop-down menu.
        \o To jump to any symbol used in the current file, select it from the
           \gui Symbols drop-down menu.
    \endlist

    When you create or edit forms in an .ui file, the toolbar contains
    \QD specific tools.

    If you are using a version control system, the toolbar enables you to
    compare the current file with the version in the repository. For more
    information on using Qt Creator with version control systems, see
    \l{Using Version Control Systems}.


    \section1 Splitting the Editor View

    Split the editor view when you want to work on and view multiple files on
    the same screen.

    \image qtcreator-spliteditorview.png

    You can split the editor view in two ways:
    \list
        \o To split the editor view into a top and bottom view, select
           \gui Window > \gui Split or press \key{Ctrl+E, 2}.

           Split command creates views below the currently active editor view.
        \o To split the editor view into adjacent views, select
           \gui Window > \gui{Split Side by Side} or press
           \key{Ctrl+E, 3}.

           Side by side split command creates views to the right of the
           currently active editor view.
    \endlist

    To move between split views, select \gui Window >
    \gui{Go to Next Split} or press \key{Ctrl+E, 0}.

    To remove a split view, place the cursor within the view you want to
    remove and select \gui Window > \gui{Remove Current Split} or press
    \key{Ctrl+E, 0}. To remove all but the currently selected split view,
    select \gui Window > \gui{Remove All Splits} or press \key{Ctrl+E, 1}.


    \section1 Highlighting and Folding Blocks

    Use block highlighting to visually separate parts of the code that belong
    together. For example, when you place the cursor within the braces,
    the code enclosed in braces is highlighted.

    \image qtcreator-blockhighlighting.png

    To enable block highlighting, select \gui Tools > \gui Options >
    \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Display > \gui{Highlight blocks}.

    Use the folding markers to collapse and expand blocks of code within
    braces. Click the folding marker to collapse or expand a block. In the
    figure above, the folding markers are located between the line number and
    the text pane.

    To show the folding markers, select \gui Tools > \gui Options >
    \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Display > \gui{Display folding markers}.


    \section1 Syntax Checking

    As you write code Qt Creator checks code syntax. When it spots syntax error
    in your code it underlines it and shows error details when you move the
    mouse pointer over the error:
    \list
        \o Syntax errors are underlined in red.

           In the following figure, semicolon is missing at the end of line.

           \image qtcreator-syntaxerror.png
        \o Semantic errors and warnings are underlined in olive.

           In the following figure, the type is unknown.

           \image qtcreator-semanticerror.png
    \endlist


    \section1 Code Completion

    As you write code Qt Creator provides a list of context-sensitive
    suggestions to the statement where your cursor is.

    \image qtcreator-codecompletion.png

    Set code completion preferences in \gui Tools > \gui Options >
    \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Completion.

    Qt Creator can complete common prefixes before showing a list of
    suggestions. This is especially useful for the classes with several
    similarly named members. To use this functionality, in the code
    completion preferences enable \gui{Autocomplete common prefix}.

    The following table lists available types for code completion and icon
    used for each.

    \title Setting Up a qmake Project

    \section1 Selecting the Qt Version

    Qt Creator allows you to have multiple versions of Qt installed on
    your computer and use different versions for your projects.

    If Qt Creator finds \bold qmake in the PATH environment variable, it uses
    that version. This \l{glossary-system-qt}{version of Qt} is referred to as
    \bold{Qt in PATH}. If you intend to use only one version of Qt and it is
    already in the PATH and correctly set up for command line use, you do not
    need to manually configure your Qt version.

    \note By default, Qt Creator compiles projects with the
    \l{glossary-default-qt}{default Qt version}. For information on how to
    override this setting, see \l{Build Settings}.

    \section2 Windows

    To add a Qt version for \bold MinGW:

    \list 1
        \o Select \gui Tools > \gui Options... > \gui Qt4 >
           \gui{Qt Versions}.
        \o Qt Creator automatically sets the correct environment variables for
           compilation. Select the internal version number of the installed
           Microsoft Visual C++ tool chains using the \gui MSVC drop-down
           box:
           \list
               \o \bold 7.1 for Visual Studio 2003
               \o \bold 8.0 for Visual Studio 2005
               \o \bold 9.0 for Visual Studio 2008
           \endlist

           \note If you are using the
           \bold{Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008}, Qt Creator identifies

    \list
        \o To add a clean step using make or a custom process, click
           \gui{Add clean step} and select the type of step you want to add.

           By default, custom steps are disabled. Activate customs steps by
           checking the \gui{Enable Custom Process Step} check-box.
        \o To remove a clean step, click \gui{Remove clean step} and select the
           step you want to remove.
        \o To change the order of steps, click
           \inlineimage qtcreator-movestep.png
           .
    \endlist

    \section2 Build Environment

    You can specify the environment you want to use for building in the
    \bold{Build Environment} section. By default, the environment in which Qt
    Creator was started is used and modified to include the Qt version.
    Depending on the selected Qt version, Qt Creator automatically sets the
    necessary environment variables. You can edit existing environment
    variables or add, reset and unset new variables based on your project
    requirements.


    \section1 Run Settings

    Qt Creator automatically creates run configurations for your project.
    These run configurations derive their executable from the parsed .pro
    files. You can also create custom executable run configurations where you
    can set the executable to be run.

    \image qtcreator-pprunsettings.png


    \section1 File Encoding

    To define the default file encoding, select the desired encoding in the
    \gui{Editor Settings}. By default, the Qt Creator uses the file encoding
    used by your system.


    \section1 Dependencies

    If you have multiple projects loaded in your session, you can define the
    dependencies between them. This affects the build order of your
    projects.

    \note These dependencies are unrelated to the dependencies inside a qmake
    project.

    To define the dependencies:
    \list 1
        \o Select the project for which you want to configure dependencies.
        \o In the \gui Dependencies section check the checkboxes to select
           other projects as dependencies.
    \endlist


    \section1 Adding External Libraries to a qmake Project

    Through external libraries Qt Creator can support code completion and
    syntax highlighting as if they were part of the current project or the Qt
    library.

    To add an external library:
    \list
        \o Open your project file (.pro) using the \gui Projects pane.
        \o Follow the instructions at \l http://doc.trolltech.com/latest/qmake-project-files.html#declaring-other-libraries
           {Declaring other Libraries}.
    \endlist

    Syntax completion and highlighting work once your project successfully
    builds and links against the external library.

    \title Writing a Simple Program

    \note This tutorial assumes that you have experience in writing basic Qt
    applications, using \QD to design user interfaces and using the Qt
    Resource System.

    This tutorial describes how to use Qt Creator
    to create a small Qt application, Text Finder. It is a simplified version of the
    QtUiTools \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/uitools-textfinder.html}{Text Finder}
    example.

    \image qtcreator-textfinder-screenshot.png

    \section1 Setting Up Your Environment

    Qt Creator automatically detects whether the location of Qt is in your \c PATH variable.
    If you have installed several Qt versions, follow the
    instructions in \l{Selecting the Qt version} to set the Qt path.

    \section1 Creating the Text Finder Project

    \note Create the project with the \gui{Help} mode active so that you can follow
    these instructions while you work.

    \list 1

        \o Select \gui{File > New File or Project > Qt Application Project > Qt Gui
        Application > OK}.

           \image qtcreator-new-project.png "New File or Project" dialog

        The \gui{Introduction and Project Location} dialog opens.

        \image qtcreator-intro-and-location.png "Introduction and Project Location dialog"

        \o In the \gui{Name} field, type \bold {TextFinder}.


        \o In the \gui {Create in} field, enter the path for the project files. For example,
        \c {C:\Qt\examples}, and then click \gui{Next}.

        The \gui{Select Required Qt Versions} dialog opens.

        \image qtcreator-new-project-qt-versions.png "Select Required Qt Versions dialog"

        \o Click \gui{Next} to use the Qt version set in the path in your project.

        The \gui{Class Information} dialog opens.

        \image qtcreator-class-info.png "Class Information" dialog

        \o In the \gui{Class Name} field, type \bold {TextFinder} as the class name.

        \o In the \gui{Base Class} list, select \bold {QWidget} as the base class type.

           \note The \gui{Header File}, \gui{Source File} and
           \gui{Form File} fields are automatically updated to match the name of the
           class.

        \o Click \gui{Next}.

        The \gui{Project Management} dialog opens.

        \image qtcreator-new-project-summary.png "Project Mangement" dialog

        \o Review the project settings, and click \gui{Finish} to create the project.


    \endlist



    The TextFinder project now contains the following files:

    \list
        \o textfinder.h
        \o textfinder.cpp
        \o main.cpp
        \o textfinder.ui
        \o textfinder.pro
    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-textfinder-contents.png "TextFinder project contents"

    The .h and .cpp files come with the necessary boiler plate code.
    The .pro file is complete.

    \section1 Filling in the Missing Pieces

    Begin by designing the user interface and then move on to filling
    in the missing code. Finally, add the find functionality.

    \section2 Designing the User Interface

    \image qtcreator-textfinder-ui.png "Text Finder UI"

    \list 1

    \o In the \gui{Editor} mode, double-click the textfinder.ui file in the \gui{Projects}
    view to launch the integrated \QD.

    \o Drag and drop the following widgets to the form:

    \list
    \o \gui{Label} (\l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qlabel.html}{QLabel})
    \o \gui{Line Edit} (\l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qlineedit.html}{QLineEdit})
    \o \gui{Push Button} (\l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qpushbutton.html}{QPushButton})

    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-textfinder-ui-widgets.png "Adding widgets to Text Finder UI"

    \o Double-click the \gui{Label} widget and enter the text \bold{Keyword}.

    \o Double-click the \gui{Push Button} widget and enter the text \bold{Find}.

    \o Press \key {Ctrl+A} to select the widgets and click \gui{Lay out Horizontally}
    (or press \gui{Ctrl+H}) to apply a horizontal layout
    (\l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qhboxlayout.html}{QHBoxLayout}).

    \image qtcreator-texfinder-ui-horizontal-layout.png "Applying horizontal layout"

    \o Drag and drop a \gui{Text Edit} widget (\l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextedit.html}{QTextEdit})
    to the form.

    \o Select the screen area and click \gui{Lay out Vertically} (or press \gui{Ctr+V})
    to apply a vertical layout (\l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qvboxlayout.html}{QVBoxLayout}).

    \image qtcreator-textfinder-ui.png "Text Finder UI"

    \o Press \gui{Ctrl+S} to save your changes.

    \endlist

    Applying the horizontal and vertical layouts ensures that the application UI scales to different
    screen sizes.

    For more information about designing forms with \QD, see the
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/designer-manual.html}{Qt Designer Manual}.

    \section2 Completing the Header File

    The textfinder.h file already has the necessary #includes, a
    constructor, a destructor, and the \c{Ui} object. You need to add a private
    slot, \c{on_findButton_clicked()}, to carry out the find operation. You
    also need a private function, \c{loadTextFile()}, to read and display the
    contents of the input text file in the
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextedit.html}{QTextEdit}.

    \list 1

    \o In the \gui{Projects} view, double-click the \c{textfinder.h} file
    to open it for editing.

    \o Add a private slot in a \c{private slots} section and a private function
    in the \c{private} section, after the \c{Ui::TextFinder} function, as
    illustrated by the following code snippet:

    \snippet examples/textfinder/textfinder.h 0

    \endlist

    \section2 Completing the Source File

    Now that the header file is complete, move on to the source file,
   textfinder.cpp.

    \list 1

    \o In the \gui{Projects} view, double-click the textfinder.cpp file
    to open it for editing.

    \o Add code to load a text file using
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qfile.html}{QFile}, read it with
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextstream.html}{QTextStream}, and
    then display it on \c{textEdit} with
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextedit.html#plainText-prop}{setPlainText()}
    This is illustrated by the following code snippet:

    \snippet examples/textfinder/textfinder.cpp 0

    \o To use \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qfile.html}{QFile} and
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextstream.html}{QTextStream}, add the
    following #includes to textfinder.cpp:

    \snippet examples/textfinder/textfinder.cpp 1

    \o For the \c{on_findButton_clicked()} slot, add code to extract the search string and
    use the \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextedit.html#find}{find()} function
    to look for the search string within the text file. This is illustrated by
    the following code snippet:

    \snippet examples/textfinder/textfinder.cpp 2

    \o Once both of these functions are complete, add a line to call \c{loadTextFile()} in
    the constructor, as illustrated by the following code snippet:

    \snippet examples/textfinder/textfinder.cpp 3

    \endlist

    The \c{on_findButton_clicked()} slot is called automatically in
    the uic generated ui_textfinder.h file by this line of code:

    \code
    QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName(TextFinder);
    \endcode

    \section2 Creating a Resource File

    You need a resource file (.qrc) within which you embed the input
    text file. The input file can be any .txt file with a paragraph of text.
    Create a text file called input.txt and store it in the textfinder
    folder.

    To add a resource file:
    \list 1
        \o Select \gui{File > New File or Project > Qt > Qt Resource File > OK}.
    \image qtcreator-add-resource-wizard.png "New File or Project dialog"

    The \gui {Choose the Location} dialog opens.

        \image qtcreator-add-resource-wizard2.png "Choose the Location dialog"

        \o In the \gui{Name} field, enter \bold{textfinder}.
        \o In the \gui{Path} field, enter \c{C:\Qt\examples\TextFinder},
        and click \gui{Next}.

        The \gui{Project Management} dialog opens.

        \image qtcreator-add-resource-wizard3.png "Project Management dialog"


        \o In the \gui{Add to project} field, select \bold{TextFinder.pro}
        and click \gui{Finish} to open the file in the code editor.

        \o Select \gui{Add > Add Prefix}.
        \o In the \gui{Prefix} field, replace the default prefix with a slash (/).
        \o Select \gui{Add > Add Files}, to locate and add input.txt.

        \image qtcreator-add-resource.png "Editing resource files"

    \endlist

    \section1 Compiling and Running Your Program

    Now that you have all the necessary files, click the \inlineimage qtcreator-run.png
    button to compile your program.

    \endtable


    \section1 Setting Up Version Control Systems

    Qt Creator uses the version control system's command line clients to
    access your repositories. To set it up, you must ensure that these command
    line clients can be located via the \c{PATH} environment variable.
    To specify the path to the command line client's executable, go to the settings
    pages in \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options...}.


    \section1 Setting Up Common Options

    The \gui{Version Control > Common} settings page features common settings for
    version control systems, such as commit message line wrapping and checking
    options.

    \gui{Submit message checking script} is a script or program that can be
    used to perform checks on the submit message before submitting. The submit
    message is passed in as the script's first parameter. If there is an error,
    the script should output a message on standard error and return a non-zero
    exit code.

    \gui{User/alias configuration file} takes a file in mailmap format that
    lists user names and aliases. For example:

    \code
    Jon Doe <Jon.Doe@company.com>
    Hans Mustermann <Hans.Mustermann@company.com> hm <info@company.com>
    \endcode

    Notice that the second line specifies the alias \e{hm} and the
    corresponding email address for \e{Hans Mustermann}. If the user/alias
    configuration file is present, the submit editor displays a context
    menu with \gui{Insert name...} that pops up a dialog letting the user
    select a name.

    \gui{User fields configuration file} is a simple text file consisting of
    lines specifying submit message fields that take user names, for example:

    \code
    Reviewed-by:
    Signed-off-by:
    \endcode

    These fields appear below the submit message. They provide completion
    for the aliases/public user names specified in the
    \e{User/alias configuration file} as well as a button that opens the
    aforementioned user name dialog.


    \section1 Using Version Control Systems

    The version control sub-menus are in \gui Tools > \gui Options...
    > \gui{Version Control}. The version control system
    managing the current project is displayed here.

    Each version control system adds a pane to the \gui{Application Output}
    panes within which it logs the commands it executes, prepended by a
    timestamp and the relevant output.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-pane.png


    \section2 Adding Files

    When you create a new file or a new project, the wizard displays a page
    asking whether the files should be added to a version control system.
    This happens when the parent directory or the project is already
    under version control and the system supports the concept of adding files,
    e.g., \bold{Perforce} and \bold{Subversion}. Alternatively, you can
    add files later by using the version control tool menus.

    With \bold{git}, there is no concept of adding files. Instead, all modified
    files must be \e{staged} for a commit.


    \section2 Viewing Diff Output

    All version control systems provide menu options to \e{diff} the current
    file or project: to compare it with the latest version stored in the
    repository and to display the differences. In Qt Creator, a diff is
    displayed in a read-only editor. If the file is accessible, you can
    double-click on a selected diff chunk and Qt Creator opens an editor
    displaying the file, scrolled to the line in question.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-diff.png


    \section2 Annotating Files

    Annotation views are obtained by selecting \gui{Annotate} or \gui{Blame}.
    This displays the lines of the file prepended by the change identifier
    they originate from. Clicking on the change identifier shows a detailed
    description of the file.

    To show the annotation of a previous version in the \gui Annotate or
    \gui Blame view, right-click on the version in the code. This option
    allows you to navigate through the history of the file and obtain the
    previous version of the code. This option also works for \gui git/hg
    using SHA.

    The file log view for a single file has \gui Annotate in
    the context menu of the version mentioned in the log, the user can
    right-click a line to open a context menu which contains
    \gui{Annotate Previous}.

    To set up a VCS repository for new projects, select \gui File >
    \gui{New File or Project...}. It enables you to initialize a
    repository for VCS that supports \gui git/hg


    \section2 Committing Changes

    Once you have finished making changes, you can submit them to the version
    control system by choosing \gui{Commit} or \gui{Submit}. Qt Creator
    displays a commit page containing a text editor, where you can enter your
    commit message, and a checkable list of modified files to be included.
    When you are done, click on \gui{Commit} to start committing. In addition,
    there is a \gui{Diff Selected Files} button that brings up a diff view of the
    files selected in the file list. Since the commit page is just another
    editor, you can go back to it by closing the diff view. Alternatively, you
    can view it from the editor combo box showing the \gui{Opened files}.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-commit.png


    \section2 Viewing Versioning History and Change Details

    The versioning history of a file is displayed by selecting
    \gui{Log} (for \bold{git}) or \gui{Filelog} (for \bold{Perforce} and
    \bold{Subversion}). Typically, the log output contains the
    date, the commit message, and a change or revision identifier.
    Click on the identifier to display a description of the change including the diff.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-log.png
    \image qtcreator-vcs-describe.png


    \section2 Using git-specific Menu Entries

    The git sub-menu contains additional entries:

    \table
        \row
            \i  \gui{Stash}
            \i  Stash local changes prior to executing a \bold{pull}.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Pull}
            \i  Pull changes from the remote repository. If there are locally
                modified files, you are prompted to stash those changes.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Branches...}
            \i  Displays the branch dialog showing the local branches at the
                top and remote branches at the bottom. To switch to the local
                branch, double-click on it. Double-clicking on a remote
                branch first creates a local branch with the same name that
                tracks the remote branch, and then switches to it.

/*!
    \contentspage index.html
    \previouspage creator-editor-refactoring.html
    \page creator-editor-locator.html
    \nextpage creator-project-managing.html

    \title Searching With the Locator

    The locator provides one of the easiest ways in Qt Creator to browse
    through projects, files, classes, methods, documentation and file systems.
    You can find the locator in the bottom left of the Qt Creator window.

    To activate the locator, press \key Ctrl+K (\key Cmd+K on Mac OS
    X) or select \gui Tools > \gui Locate....

    \image qtcreator-locator.png

    To edit the currently open project's main.cpp file using the locator:
    \list 1
        \o Activate the locator by pressing \key Ctrl+K.
        \o Enter \c{main.cpp}.

           \image qtcreator-locator-open.png
        \o Press \key Return.

           The main.cpp file opens in the editor.
    \endlist

    It is also possible to enter only a part of a search string.
    As you type, the locator shows the occurrences of that string regardless
    of where in the name of an item it appears.

    To narrow down the search results, you can use the following wildcard
    characters:
    \list
        \o To match any number of any or no characters, enter \tt \bold{*}.
        \o To match a single instance of any character, enter \tt \bold{?}.
    \endlist

    \section1 Using the Locator Filters

    The \gui Locator allows you to browse not only files, but any items
    defined by \bold{locator filters}. By default, the locator contains
    filters which locate:
    \list
        \o  Any open document
        \o  Files anywhere on your file systems
        \o  Files belonging to your project, such as source, header resource,
            and .ui files
        \o  Class and method definitions in your project or anywhere referenced
            from your project
        \o  Help topics, including Qt documentation
        \o  Specific line in the document displayed in your editor
    \endlist

    To use a specific locator filter, type the assigned prefix followed by
    \key Space. The prefix is usually a single character.

    For example, to locate symbols matching
    \l http://doc.trolltech.com/qdatastream.html}{QDataStream:
    \list 1
        \o Activate the locator.
        \o Enter \tt{\bold{: QDataStream}} (: (colon) followed by a
           \key Space and the symbol name (QDataStream)).

           The locator lists the results.

           \image qtcreator-navigate-popup.png
    \endlist

    By default the following filters are enabled and you do not need to use
    their prefixes explicitly:
    \list
        \o Going to a line in the current file (l).
        \o Going to an open file (o).
        \o Going to a file in any open project (a).
    \endlist

    \section2 Using the Default Locator Filters

    The following locator filters are available by default:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Function
            \o  Enter in locator
            \o  Example
        \row
            \o  Go to a line in the current file.
            \o  \tt{\bold{l \e{Line number}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-line.png
        \row
            \o  Go to a symbol definition.
            \o  \tt{\bold{: \e{Symbol name}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-symbols.png
        \row
            \o  Go to a help topic.
            \o  \tt{\bold{? \e{Help topic}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-help.png
        \row
            \o  Go to an open file.
            \o  \tt{\bold{o \e{File name}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-opendocs.png
        \row
            \o  Go to a file in the file system (browse the file system).
            \o  \tt{\bold{f \e{File name}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-filesystem.png
        \row
            \o  Go to a file in any project currently open.
            \o  \tt{\bold{a \e{File name}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-files.png
        \row
            \o  Go to a file in the current project.
            \o  \tt{\bold{p \e{File name}}}
            \o  \image qtcreator-locator-current-project.png

    \section2 Creating Locator Filters

    To quickly access files not directly mentioned in your project, you can
    create your own locator filters. That way you can locate files in a
    directory structure you have defined.

    To create a locator filter:
    \list 1
        \o In the locator, click \inlineimage qtcreator-locator-magnify.png
           and select \gui Configure....

           \image qtcreator-locator-customize.png

        \o In the \gui Options window click \gui Add.
        \o In the \gui{Filter Configuration} dialog:
        \list
            \o Name your filter.
            \o Select at least one directory. The locator searches directories
               recursively.
            \o Define the file pattern as a comma separated list. For example,
               to search all .h and .cpp files, enter \tt \bold{*.h,*.cpp}
            \o Specify the prefix string.

               To show only results matching this filter, select
               \gui{Limit to prefix}.

               \image qtcreator-navigate-customfilter.png
        \endlist
        \o Click OK.
    \endlist

    \section3 Configuring the Locator Cache

    The locator searches the files matching your file pattern in the
    directories you have selected and caches that information. The cache for
    all default filters is updated as you write your code. The filters you have
    created Qt Creator by default updates once an hour.

    To update the cached information manually, click
    \inlineimage qtcreator-locator-magnify.png
    and select \gui Refresh.

    To set a new cache update time:
    \list 1
        \o Select \gui Tools > \gui Options... > \gui Locator.
        \o In \gui{Refresh interval} define new time in minutes.
    \endlist

    \title Managing Sessions

    In Qt Creator, a session is a collection of:

    \list
        \o Open projects with their dependencies
        \o Open editors
        \o Breakpoints and watches
        \o Bookmarks
    \endlist

    When you launch Qt Creator, a list of existing sessions is displayed on the
    \gui{Welcome screen}.

    \image qtcreator-welcome-session.png

    To switch between sessions, select the session from sessions listed in
    \gui File > \gui Session. If you do not create or select a session,
    Qt Creator always uses the default session.

    To create a new session or remove existing sessions, select \gui File >
    \gui Sessions > \gui{Session Manager}.

    \title Debugging


    \section1 About Debugging with Qt Creator

    Qt Creator does not have its own debugger. Instead, it provides a graphical
    frontend to various debugger engines:

    \table
        \header
            \o Platform
            \o Compiler
            \o Debugger Engine
        \row
            \o Linux, Unixes, Mac OS
            \o gcc
            \o GNU Symbolic Debugger (gdb)
        \row
            \o Windows/MinGW
            \o gcc
            \o GNU Symbolic Debugger (gdb)
        \row
            \o Windows
            \o Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
            \o Debugging Tools for Windows/Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB)
    \endtable

    The frontend allows you to:
    \list
        \o Go through a program line-by-line or instruction-by-instruction.
        \o Interrupt running programs.
        \o Set breakpoints.
        \o Examine the contents of the call stack, local and global variables, etc.
    \endlist

    Qt Creator displays the raw information provided by the engine
    in a clear and concise manner. This simplifies the debugging process.

    Qt Creator comes with generic IDE functionality: stack view, views for locals and
    watchers, registers, etc. In addition, Qt Creator includes features to make
    debugging Qt-based applications easy. The debugger frontend understands the
    internal layout of several Qt classes such as QString, the QTL containers,
    and most importantly QObject (and classes derived from it), as well as
    most containers of the C++ Standard Library. Therefore, the debugger can
    present their contents in a useful way.

               \l{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx}
               {Microsoft Developer Network}.

               The pre-built \e{Qt SDK for Windows} makes use
               of the library if it is present on the system. When building Qt
               Creator using the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler, the
               \c{"%ProgramFiles%\Debugging Tools for Windows"} path is
               checked to ensure that all required header files are there.
       \row
           \o Debugging tools for Mac OS X
           \o The Qt binary distribution contains both debug and release
              variants of the libraries. But you have to explicitly tell the
              runtime linker that you want to use the debug libraries even if
              your application is compiled as debug as release is the default
              library.

              If you use a qmake based project in Qt Creator,  you can set a
              flag in your run configuration, in Projects mode. In the run
              configuration, select \gui{Use debug version of frameworks}.

              For more detailed information about debugging on the Mac, refer:

    \endtable


    \section1 Interaction with the Debugger

    In \gui Debug mode, several dock widgets are used to interact with the
    program you are debugging. The frequently used dock widgets are visible by
    default; the rarely used ones are hidden. To change the default settings,
    select \gui Debug and then select \gui View.

    \image qtcreator-debug-view.png

    Here, you can lock or unlock the location of your dock widgets as well as
    display or hide them. The position of your dock widgets is saved for future
    sessions.


    \section2 Usage of the Debugger

    To start a program under the debugger's control, select the \gui{Debug}
    menu and \gui{Start Debugging}, or press \key{F5}. Qt Creator
    checks whether the compiled program is up-to-date, rebuilding it if
    necessary. The debugger then takes over and starts the program.

    \note Starting a program in the debugger can take a considerable amount of
    time, typically in the range of several seconds to minutes if complex
    features (like QtWebKit) are used.

    Once the program starts running, it behaves and performs as usual.
    The user can interrupt a running program by selecting
    \gui {Interrupt} from the \gui{Debug} menu. The program is automatically
    interrupted as soon as a breakpoint is hit.

    Once the program stops, Qt Creator:

    \list
        \o Retrieves data representing the call stack at the program's current
           position.
        \o Retrieves the contents of local variables.
        \o Examines \gui Watchers.
        \o Updates the \gui Registers, \gui Modules, and \gui Disassembler
           views.
    \endlist


    You can use the debugger views to examine the data in more detail.

    To finish debugging, press \key{Shift+F5}. A line of code can be executed
    as a whole with \key F10; to step into a function or a sub-function, use
    \key F11. Alternatively, you can continue running the program with \key F5.
    It is also possible to continue executing the program until the current
    function completes or jump to an arbitrary position in the current
    function.


    \section2 Breakpoints

    Breakpoints are shown in the \gui{Breakpoints} view which is enabled
    by default. This view is also accessible when the debugger and the program
    being debugged is not running.

    A breakpoint represents a position or sets of positions in the code that,
    when executed, interrupts the program being debugged and passes the
    control to the user. The user is then free to examine the state of the
    interrupted program, or continue execution either line-by-line or continuously.

    Typically, breakpoints are associated with a source code file and line, or
    the start of a function -- both are allowed in Qt Creator.

    Also, the interruption of a program by a breakpoint can be restricted with
    certain conditions.

    You can set a breakpoint:

    \list
       \o At a particular line you want the program to stop -- click on the
          left margin or press \key F9 (\key F8 for Mac OS X).
       \o At a function that you want the program to interrupt -- enter the
          function's name in \gui{Set Breakpoint at Function...} located in the
          context menu of the breakpoints view.
    \endlist

    \note

    You can remove a breakpoint:

    \list
        \o By clicking on the breakpoint marker in the text editor.
        \o By selecting the breakpoint in the breakpoint view and pressing
           \key{Delete}.
        \o By selecting \gui{Delete Breakpoint} from the breakpoint's context
           menu in the \gui Breakpoints view.
    \endlist

    Breakpoints can be set and deleted before the program has actually started
    running or while it is running under the debugger's control. Also,
    breakpoints are saved together with a session.


    \section2 Stack

    When the program being debugged is interrupted, Qt Creator displays the
    nested function calls leading to the current position as a \e call stack
    trace. This stack trace is built up from \e{call stack frames}, each
    representing a particular function. For each function, Qt Creator tries
    to retrieve the file name and line number of the corresponding source
    file. This data is shown in the \gui Stack view.

    \image qtcreator-debug-stack.png

    Since the call stack leading to the current position may originate or go
    through code for which no debug information is available, not all stack
    frames have corresponding source locations. These frames are
    grayed out in the \gui Stack view.

    If you click on a frame with a known source location, the text editor
    jumps to the corresponding location and updates the \gui{Locals and Watchers}
    view, making it seem like the program was interrupted before entering the
    function.


    \section2 Threads

    If a multi-threaded program is interrupted, the \gui Thread view  or the
    combobox named \gui Thread in the debugger's status bar can be used to
    switch from one thread to another. The \gui Stack view adjusts itself
    accordingly.


    \section2 Modules View and Source Files View

    These views display the debugger's idea of the components of the
    application. By default, both views are hidden.


    \section2 Disassembler View and Registers View

    By default, both \gui Disassembler and \gui Registers view are hidden.
    The \gui Disassembler view displays disassembled code for the current
    function; the \gui Registers view displays the current state of the CPU's
    registers. Both views are useful for low-level commands such as
    \gui{Step Single Instruction} and \gui{Step Over Single Instruction}.

    \section2 Locals and Watchers

    Whenever a program stops under the control of the debugger, it retrieves
    information about the topmost stack frame and displays it in the
    \gui{Locals and Watchers} view. This typically includes information about
    parameters of the function in that frame as well as the local variables.

    Compound variables of struct or class type are displayed as
    "expandable" in the view. Click on the "+" to expand the entry and show
    all members. Together with the display of value and type, the user can
    examine and traverse the low-level layout of an object's data.


    \table
        \row
            \i  \bold{Note:}

        \row
            \i  Gdb, and therefore Qt Creator's debugger works for optimized
                builds on Linux and Mac OS X. However, optimization may lead
                to re-ordering of instructions or sometimes even complete
                removal of some local variables. In this case, the
                \gui{Locals and Watchers} view may show unexpected data.

        \row
            \i  The debug information provided by gcc does not include enough
                information about the time when a variable is initialized.
                Therefore, Qt Creator can not tell whether the contents of a
                local variable contains "real data", or "initial noise". If a
                QObject appears uninitialized, its value is reported as
                "out of scope". However, not all uninitialized objects can be
                recognized as such.
    \endtable


    The \gui{Locals and Watchers} view also provides access to the most
    powerful feature of the debugger: comprehensive display of data belonging
    to Qt's basic objects. To enable this feature, check \gui{Use
    debugging helper} checkbox from \gui Tools > \gui Options... >
    \gui Debugger > \gui{Debugging Helper}. The \gui{Locals and Watchers} view
    is re-organized to provide a high-level view of the objects. For example,
    in case of QObject, instead of displaying a pointer to some private data
    structure, you see a list of children, signals and slots.

    Similarly, instead of displaying many pointers and integers, Qt Creator's
    debugger displays the contents of a QHash or QMap in an orderly manner.
    Also, the debugger displays access data for QFileInfo and provides
    access to the "real" contents of QVariant.

    The \gui{Locals and Watchers} view can be used to change the contents of
    variables of simple data types such as \c int or \c float when the program
    is interrupted. To do so, click on the \gui Value column, modify the value
    with the inplace editor, and hit \key Enter (or \key Return).

    \note The set of watched items is saved in your session.


    \section1 Walkthrough for the Debugger Frontend

    In our \l{Writing a Simple Program}{TextFinder} example, we
    read a text file into QString and then display it with QTextEdit.
    Suppose you want to look at this QString, \c{line}, and see what
    data it actually stores. Follow the steps described below to place a
    breakpoint and view the QString object's data.

    \list 1
        \o Click in between the line number and the window border on the line
        where we invoke \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextedit.html#plainText-prop}{setPlainText()}
        to set a breakpoint.
        \o Select \gui{Start Debugging} from the \gui{Debug} menu or press \key{F5}.
    \endlist

        \row
            \i \inlineimage qtcreator-setting-breakpoint2.png
            \i \bold{Viewing and removing breakpoints}

    Breakpoints are visible in the \gui{Breakpoints} view in
    \gui{Debug} mode. To remove a breakpoint, right-click on
    it and select \gui{Delete breakpoint} from the context menu.

        \row
            \i \inlineimage qtcreator-watcher.png

    To view the contents of \c{line}, go to the \gui{Locals and
    Watchers} view.

    \endtable

    Suppose we modify our \c{on_findButton_clicked()} function to move back to
    the start of the document and continue searching once the cursor hits the
    end of the document. Adding this functionality can be done with the code
    snippet below:

    \code
    void TextFinder::on_findButton_clicked()
    {
        QString searchString = ui->lineEdit->text();

        QTextDocument *document = ui->textEdit->document();
        QTextCursor cursor = ui->textEdit->textCursor();
        cursor = document->find(searchString, cursor,
            QTextDocument::FindWholeWords);
        ui->textEdit->setTextCursor(cursor);

        bool found = cursor.isNull();

        if (!found && previouslyFound) {
            int ret = QMessageBox::question(this, tr("End of Document"),
            tr("I have reached the end of the document. Would you like "
            "me to start searching from the beginning of the document?"),
            QMessageBox::Yes | QMessageBox::No, QMessageBox::Yes);

            if (ret == QMessageBox::Yes) {
                cursor = document->find(searchString,
                    QTextDocument::FindWholeWords);
                ui->textEdit->setTextCursor(cursor);
            } else
                return;
        }
        previouslyFound = found;
    }
    \endcode

    However, if you compile and run this code, the application does not work
    correctly due to a logic error. To locate this logic error, step
    through the code using the following buttons:

    \image qtcreator-debugging-buttons.png

    \section1 Setting the Symbol Server

    To obtain operating system libraries for debugging Windows applications,
    you have to add the Symbol Server:
    \list 1
        \o  Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Debugger > \gui Cdb
        \o  Click \inlineimage qtcreator-serverbutton.png
            located next to the \gui{Insert...} button of the Symbol paths
            field and select \gui{Symbol Server...}
        \o  Select a directory where you want to store the cached information
            and click \gui OK.
    \endlist

    \section1 Debugging Helper Library with C++

    While debugging, Qt Creator dynamically loads a helper library into your
    program. This helper library enables Qt Creator to pretty print Qt and STL
    types. The Qt SDK package already contains a prebuilt debugging helper
    library. To create an own debugging helper library, select \gui{Options}
    from the \gui{Tools} menu, and go to the \gui{Qt4 > Qt Versions} pane. As
    the internal data structures of Qt can change between versions, the debugging
    helper library is built for each Qt version.


    \section1 Debugging Helper Library with Python

    Using a gdb version that has Python scripting available it is possible to
    use Debugging Helpers also for user defined types. All that is needed is
    to define one Python function per user defined type in .gdbinit.

    The function's name has to be qdump__NS__Foo where NS::Foo is the class
    or class template to be examined. Nested namespaces are possible.

    Qt Creator's debugger integration will call this function whenever it
    wants to display an object of this type. The function gets passed two
    parameters, 'd' of type 'Dumper', and 'item' of type 'Item'. The function
    itself has to feed the Dumper object with certain information which is
    used to build up the object and its children's display in the
    Locals-and-Watchers view.


    Example:

    \code
    def qdump__QVector(d, item):
        d_ptr = item.value["d"]
        p_ptr = item.value["p"]
        alloc = d_ptr["alloc"]
        size = d_ptr["size"]

        check(0 <= size and size <= alloc and alloc <= 1000 * 1000 * 1000)
        check(d_ptr["ref"]["_q_value"] > 0)

        innerType = item.value.type.template_argument(0)
        d.putItemCount(size)
        d.putNumChild(size)
        if d.isExpanded(item):
            p = gdb.Value(p_ptr["array"]).cast(innerType.pointer())
            d.beginChildren([size, 2000], innerType)
            for i in d.childRange():
                d.safePutItem(Item(p.dereference(), item.iname, i))
                p += 1
            d.endChildren()
    \endcode

    \section2

    The 'Item' Python class is a thin wrapper around values corresponding to one
    line in the Locals-and-Watchers view. Its members are the following:

    \list

    \o \gui{__init__(self, value, parentiname, iname, name = None)} - A
       constructor. The object's internal name is created by concatenating
       \a parentiname and \a iname. If \c None is passed as \a name, a
       serial number is used.

    \o \gui{value} - An object of type gdb.Value representing the value to
        be displayed.

    \o \gui{iname} - The internal name of the object, i.e. a dot-separated
    list of identifiers, corresponding to the position of the object's
    representation in the view.

    \o \gui{name} - An optional name. If given, it will be used in the
    \gui{name} column of the view. If not, a simple number in brackets
    will be used instead.

    \endlist


    \section2

    For each line in the Locals and Watcher view, a string like the following
    needs to be created and channeled to Creator's debugger plugin.
    \code
    "{iname='some internal name',
      addr='object address in memory',
      name='contents of the name column',
      value='contents of the value column',
      type='contents of the type column',
      numchild='number of children',        // zero/nonzero is sufficient
      childtype='default type of children', // optional
      childnumchild='default number of grandchildren', // optional
      children=[              // only needed if item is expanded in view
         {iname='internal name of first child',
          ... },
         {iname='internal name of second child',
          ... },
         ...
      ]}"
    \endcode

    While in theory, this string can be build up entirely manually, it is
    easier to employ the 'Dumper' Python class for that purpose. It contains
    a complete framework to take care of the 'iname' and 'addr' fields,
    to handle children of simple types, references,
    pointers, enums, known and unknown structs as well as some
    convenience methods to handle common situations.

    The 'Dumper' members are the following:

    \list

    \o \gui{__init__(self)} - Initializes the output to an empty string and
        empties the child stack.

    \o \gui{put(self, value)} - Low level method to directly append to the
        output string.

    \o \gui{putCommaIfNeeded(self)} - Appends a comma if the current output
        ends in '}', '"' or ']' .

    \o \gui{putField(self, name, value)} - Appends a comma if needed, and a
         name='value' field.

    \o \gui{beginHash(self)} - Appends a comma if needed and a '{', marking
        the begin of a set of fields.

    \o \gui{endHash(self)} - Appends a '}', marking the end of a set of
        fields.

    \o \gui{beginItem(self, name)} - Starts writing a field by writing \c {name='}.

    \o \gui{endItem(self)} - Ends writing a field by writing \c {'}.

    \o \gui{beginChildren(self, numChild_ = 1, childType_ = None, childNumChild_ = None)}
        - Starts writing a list of \a numChild children, with type
        \a childType_ and \a childNumChild_ grandchildren each. If \a numChild_
        is a list of two integers, the first one specifies the actual number
        of children and the second the maximum number of children to print.

    \o \gui{endChildren(self)} - Ends writing a list of children.

    \o \gui{childRange(self)} - Return the range of children specified in
        \c beginChildren.

    \o \gui{putItemCount(self, count)} - Appends a field  \c {value='<%d items'}
        to the output.

    \o \gui{putEllipsis(self)} - Appends fields
        \c {'{name="<incomplete>",value="",type="",numchild="0"}'}. This is
        automatically done by \c endChildren if the number of children to
        print is smaller than the number of actual children.

    \o \gui{putName(self, name)} - Appends a \c {name='...'} field.

    \o \gui{putType(self, type)} - Appends a field \c {type='...'} unless the
        \a type coincides with the parent's default child type.

    \o \gui{putNumChild(self, numchild)} - Appends a field \c {numchild='...'}
        unless the \a numchild coincides with the parent's default child numchild
        value.

    \o \gui{putValue(self, value, encoding = None)} - Append a file \c {value='...'},
        optionally followed by a field \c {valueencoding='...'}. The \a value
        needs to be convertible to a string entirely consisting of
        alphanumerical values. The \a encoding parameter can be used to
        specify the encoding in case the real value had to be encoded in some
        way to meet the alphanumerical-only requirement.
        Currently the following encodings are supported:

        \list
            \o 0: unencoded 8 bit data, interpreted as Latin1.

            \o 1: base64 encoded 8 bit data, used for QByteArray,
                double quotes will be added.

            \o 2: base64 encoded 16 bit data, used for QString,
                double quotes will be added.

            \o 3: base64 encoded 32 bit data,
                double quotes will be added.

            \o 4: base64 encoded 16 bit data, without quotes (see 2)

            \o 5: base64 encoded 8 bit data, without quotes (see 1)

            \o 6: %02x encoded 8 bit data (as with \c QByteArray::toHex),
                double quotes will be added.

            \o 7: %04x encoded 16 bit data (as with \c QByteArray::toHex),
                double quotes will be added.
        \endlist

    \o \gui{putStringValue(self, value)} - Encodes a QString and calls
        \c putValue with the correct \a encoding setting.

    \o \gui{putByteArrayValue(self, value)} - Encodes a QByteArray and calls
        \c putValue with the corrent \a encoding setting.

    \o \gui{isExpanded(self, item)} - Checks whether the item with the
        internal name \c item.iname is expanded in the view.

    \o \gui{isExpandedIName(self, iname)} - Checks whether the item with the
        internal name \c iname is expanded in the view.

    \o \gui{putIntItem(self, name, value)} - Equivalent to
        \code
        self.beginHash()
        self.putName(name)
        self.putValue(value)
        self.putType("int")
        self.putNumChild(0)
        self.endHash()
        \endcode

    \o \gui{putBoolItem(self, name, value)} - Equivalent to
        \code
        self.beginHash()
        self.putName(name)
        self.putValue(value)
        self.putType("bool")
        self.putNumChild(0)
        self.endHash()
        \endcode

    \o \gui{pushOutput(self)} - Moves the output string to a safe location
        from with it will be sent to the frontend even if further operations
        raise an exception.

    \o \gui{putCallItem(self, name, item, func)} -
        Uses gdb to call the function \a func on the value specified by
        \a {item.value} and output the resulting item. This function is
        not available when debugging core dumps and it is not available
        on the Symbian platform due to restrictions imposed by AppTRK.

    \o \gui{putItemHelper(self, item)} - The "master function", handling
        basic types, references, pointers and enums directly, iterates
        over base classes and class members of compound types and calls
        \c qdump__* functions whenever appropriate.

    \o \gui{putItem(self, item)} - Equivalent to
        self.beginHash()
        self.putItemHelper(item)
        self.endHash()

    \o \gui{safePutItemHelper(self, item)} - Calls \c putItemHelper(self, item).
        If an exception is raised, catch it, and replace all output produced by
        \c putItemHelper with the output of \code
            self.putName(item.name)
            self.putValue("<invalid>")
            self.putType(str(item.value.type))
            self.putNumChild(0)
            self.beginChildren()
            self.endChildren() \endcode


    \o \gui{safePutItem(self, item)} - Equivalent to
        self.beginHash()
        self.safePutItemHelper(item)
        self.endHash()

    \endlist

    \title Setting Up a CMake Project

    Since Qt Creator 1.1, support for \c CMake project files is available.
    Qt Creator 1.3 supports the Microsoft Toolchain if the CMake version
    is at least 2.8.

    \section1 Opening CMake Projects

    To open a \c CMake project, select \gui Open from the \gui File menu and
    select the \c{CMakeLists.txt} file from your \c CMake project. A wizard
    guides you with the rest of the process. If the \c CMake project does
    not have an in-place build, Qt Creator lets you specify the directory in
    which the project is built (\l{glossary-shadow-build}{shadow build}).

    \image qtcreator-cmake-import-wizard1.png

    The screenshot below shows how you can specify command line arguments to
    \c CMake for your project.

    \image qtcreator-cmake-import-wizard2.png

    Normally, there is no need to pass any command line arguments for projects
    that are already built, as \c CMake caches that information.


    \section1 Building CMake Projects

    Qt Creator builds \c CMake projects by running \c make, \c mingw32-make, or
    \c nmake depending on your platform. The build errors and warnings are
    parsed and displayed in the \gui{Build Issues} output pane.

    By default, Qt Creator builds the \e{all} target. You can specify which
    targets to build in \gui{Project} mode, under \gui{Build Settings}.

    \image qtcreator-cmake-build-settings.png

    Qt Creator supports multiple build configurations. Also, the build
    directory can be modified after the initial import.

    \section1 Running CMake Projects
    Qt Creator automatically adds \gui{Run Configurations} for all targets
    specified in the \c CMake project file.

    Known issues for the current version can be found
    \l{Known Issues of version 1.3.82}{here}.


    \section1 Adding External Libraries to a CMake Project

    Through external libraries Qt Creator can support code completion and
    syntax highlighting as if they were part of the current project or the Qt
    library.

    External libraries are detected using the \c FIND_PACKAGE() macro. Some
    libraries come with the CMake installation. You can find those in the
    \b Modules directory of your CMake installation. If you provide your own
    libraries, you also need to provide your own \c FindFoo.cmake file.
    For more information, see
    \l{http://vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Writing_FindXXX.cmake_files}{CMake FAQ}.

    Syntax completion and highlighting work once your project successfully
    builds and links against the external library.
*/

    \previouspage creator-project-cmake.html
    \page creator-project-generic.html
    \nextpage creator-project-managing-sessions.html

    \title Setting Up a Generic Project

    Qt Creator supports generic projects, so you can import existing projects
    that do not use qmake or CMake and Qt Creator ignores your build system

    This allows you to use Qt Creator as a code editor. You can change the
    way your project is built by modifying the \c make command in the
    \gui Projects mode under \gui{Build Settings}.

    When you import a project, Qt Creator creates the following files that
    allow you to specify which files belong to your project and which include
    directories or defines you want to pass to your compile:
    .files, .includes, and .config.


    \section1 Importing a Generic Project

    To import an existing generic project:
    \list 1
        \o Select \gui File > \gui{New File or Project...} > \gui Projects >
           \gui{Import Existing Project}.
        \o In \gui{Generic Project}, enter the project name
           and select the project file you want to import.

           Qt Creator automatically generates the following files in the
           project directory:
           \list
               \o \l{Specifying Files}{.files}
               \o \l{Specifying Include Paths}{.includes}
               \o \l{Specifying Defines}{.config}
               \o .creator
           \endlist
    \endlist

    When the project is successfully imported, Qt Creator creates its project
    tree in the sidebar.

    After importing a generic project into Qt Creator, open it by selecting the
    .creator file.


    \section1 Working with Generic Project Files

    For a generic project, you have to manually specify which files belong to
    your project and which include directories or defines you want to pass to
    your compiler.


    \section1 Specifying Files

    The list of files for a generic project is specified in the \c .files
    file. When you first create a generic project, Qt Creator adds any
    files it recognizes to your project.

    To add or remove files, edit the \c .files file in Qt Creator.
    Qt Creator recreates your project tree when you save the \c{.files file}.
    Alternatively, you can add and remove files using the context menu in the
    project tree.

    If you frequently need to update the \c .files file, you can do it
    efficiently by using a script that updates the file for you. If the file
    is modified externally, you have to restart Qt Creator for the changes to
    take effect.

    To update the \c .files on the \gui git repository use the following
    script:
    \code
    git ls-files *.cpp > MyProject.files
    \endcode

    \section1 Specifying Include Paths

    The include paths are specified in the \c{.includes} file, one include
    path per line. The paths can be either absolute or relative to the
    \c{.includes} file.

    \section1 Specifying Defines

    The defines are specified in the \c .config file. This is a regular C++
    file, prepended to all your source files when they are parsed. However,
    use it only to add lines like the following:

    \code
    #define NAME value
    \endcode


    \section1 Creating a Run Configuration

    Qt Creator cannot automatically determine which executable to run.

    To define the executable file to run, in the \gui Projects mode under
    \gui{Run Settings}:
    \list 1
        \o Click \gui Add and select \gui{Custom Executable}.
        \o Define the configuration name, the location of the executable, any
           additional arguments you want to and the working directory.
    \endlist


    \section1 Adding External Libraries to a Generic Project

    Through external libraries Qt Creator can support code completion and
    syntax highlighting as if they were part of the current project or the Qt
    library.

    If you import a project using the \gui{Import Existing Project}
    function, Qt Creator creates a file called <projectname>.includes in your
    project directory. This file contains all project subdirectories for which
    Qt Creator found relevant headers. Add your include paths here.

    Note that in \gui Projects mode of a generic project, Qt Creator does not
    modify any project settings prior to the build.

    Syntax completion and highlighting work once your project successfully
    builds and links against the external library.

    \title Implementing Application UI

    You can either create QML projects from scratch or import them to
    Qt Creator.

    \section1 Creating QML Projects

    Select \gui {File > New File or Project > QML Project > QML Application}.

    \QMLD creates the following files:

    \list

    \o .qmlproject project file defines that all QML, JavaScript, and image
    files in the project folder belong to the project. Therefore, you do not
    need to individually list all the files in the project.

    \o .qml file defines an item, such as a widget, screen, or the whole
    application UI.

    \endlist

    To use JavaScript and image files in the application, copy them to the
    project folder.

    To import a QML project to Qt Creator, select
    \gui {File > New File or Project > QML Project > Import Existing QML Directory}.

    \section1 Designing Application UI

    One .qml file can define a widget, screen, or the whole application.

    \section2 Creating Widgets

    You can use the \gui Library items to create your own widgets. Drag and drop
    them to the editor and modify their properties in the \gui Properties pane.
    You can use QML to add properties for a widget. The properties are automatically
    displayed in the \gui Properties pane.

    Save the widgets as .qml files. You can import them to screens and applications.

    \section2 Creating Screens

    You can use the \gui Library items to create screens. Use states and transitions
    to navigate between screens.

    To add interaction methods, drag and drop a \gui {Focus Scope} or \gui {Mouse Area}
    to the screen. In the code editor, add functions to execute when users select
    the scope or area.


    \section1 Implementing Application Logic

    You can write JavaScript to implement the application logic. To include the script
    files in the project, copy them to the project folder.

    \title Developing Maemo Applications

    Maemo is a software platform developed by Nokia for smartphones and
    Internet Tablets. The platform is based on the Linux operating system
    which itself is derived from the Unix operating system. The platform
    comprises of the Maemo operating system and Maemo SDK. The Maemo SDK
    provides an open development environment for different applications on
    top of the maemo platform. Maemo 5 is based on the Linux 2.6 operating
    system. For more information refer,
    \l{http://maemo.org/intro/platform/}{Maemo platform}.



    \section1 Getting Started with Maemo Based Applications

    To begin development for maemo applications, you require the following:
    \list
       \o  An N900 device with updates installed.
       \o \bold MADDE is the acronym for Maemo Application Development and
           Debugging Environment. It is a cross-platform maemo development
           tool. For more information about \bold MADDE pertaining to its
           installation, configuration, and deployment on the device refer to
          \l{http://wiki.maemo.org/MADDE}{MADDE Preview}
       \o  In order to setup the device IP address, you need to install
           PC Connectivity or implement using CLI. For information on PC
           Connectivity refer to the link,
          \l{http://pc-connectivity.garage.maemo.org/2nd_edition/node3.html#SECTION00032300000000000000}
           {PC Connectivity}.
    \endlist

    For deploying and running applications on the device, you need the
    following:
    \list
       \o The Nokia USB drivers that come e.g. with PC Suite
       \o Qt Creator should be installed on the device. A simple technique to
          do this to run the maemo device \gui{Application Manager} and
          download any application using Qt Creator. This installs all
          dependencies required for Qt Creator at the same time.
    \endlist

    \section2 Supported Platform

     The Qt Creator/MADDE integration is supported on the following platforms:
    \list
       \o  Linux (32 bit and 64 bit)
       \o  Windows (32 bit and 64 bit)
    \endlist

    \section1 Setting Up the N900

    \note The following assumes that you use the device's USB network
     functionality. If you plan to connect your development PC to the N900
     via a common WLAN network, you can ignore the USB-specific parts in the
     following sections.

     \section2 Installing the Mad Developer Package

     To install the Mad Developer package on your device, follow the steps
     listed below:
     \list 1
         \o Open the application manager and select,
            \gui{Application catalogues} > \gui New.
            Enter the data as displayed in the screenshot below
            \note The complete web address is
            \l http://repository.maemo.org/extras-devel

            \image qtcreator-app-manager-extras-devel-screenshot.png

         \o Click \gui Save and close the application manager.
         \o Start xterm and create root: sudo gainroot.
         \o Install \gui{apt-get install mad-developer}.
         \o Start the Mad Developer apllication.
     \endlist

   \note In case you are using Microsoft Windows as development host, you will
         need to change the driver loaded for instantiating the connection.
         For this click, \gui{Manage USB} and select \gui{Load g_ether}.

    Click \gui Edit in the usb0 row and confirm with \gui Configure. No
    changes need to be made by default. The usb0 row should now display the
    IP address 192.168.2.15. Now select \gui{Developer Password} to generate
    a password for a freshly created user called "developer".
    The password will stay valid for as long this dialog is open.
    Refer to the screenshot below as an example.

    \image qtcreator-mad-developer-screenshot.png

    \section2 Installing the gdbserver

    If you plan to debug your application on the N900 via Qt Creator, you will
    need the gdbserver application, which is part of the gdb packages.
    This package is not available in the standard repository yet,
    as it is under development currently. This requires setting up another
    repository in the application manager. Follow the steps as mentioned in
    Installing the Mad Developer package and
    enter the data as displayed in the screenshot below.

    \image qtcreator-app-manager-sdk-screenshot.png

    Click \gui Save and exit the application manager. Now you can
    install gdb. Again, use the xterm and gain root access.
    You can install gdb via xterm: \gui{apt-get install gdb}.

    \section2 Establishing the USB Connection

    Connect your device to the development PC via the USB cable. A dialog will
    pop up asking for the mode to use. Choose \gui{PC suite mode}.

    \note There have been reports about connection problems due to unreliable
    USB ports. Switching to a different port might help in such a case.

    \section1 Setting Up the Host PC

    \section2 Establishing the USB Connection

    \section3 Linux

    Run the following command in a shell as root user:
                  \c{ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.14 up}

    \section3 Windows

    For Microsoft Windows, you will have perform the same steps via the Network
    configuration tools available with the operating system.
    Please open the network interface properties as shown in following
    screenshots:
    \image qtcreator-win-usb-network1.png
    \image qtcreator-win-usb-network2.png
    \image qtcreator-win-usb-network3.png

    Change the IP to be set statically and enter the following values:
    \list
       \o  IP Address: 192.168.2.14
       \o  SubnetMask: 255.255.255.0
    \endlist

    Accept these settings and close the Network Configuration. Depending on
    your version of Microsoft Windows you might have to unplug and re-plug the
    N900 to reload the driver with its according configuration.

    \section2 Setting Up MADDE

    After having downloaded the MADDE installer file for your platform from
    \l{http://wiki.maemo.org/MADDE}{here}, execute it and follow the
    instructions. The package will be installed. Then run:
    \c{mad-admin list targets} to see which targets are available.
    One of them should start with "fremantle". Install that one:
    \c{mad-admin create fremantle-qt-xxx}.
    After that, you will have a toolchain and a sysroot environment for
    cross-compiling available.


    \section1 Setting Up Qt Creator

    \section2 Registering the MADDE Toolchain

    Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Qt4 > \gui{Qt Versions}.
    Click \inlineimage qtcreator-windows-add.png,
    to add a new Qt version. The \gui{qMake Location} is the qmake executable
    in \c{<MADDE dir>/targets/<fremantle target>/bin}.

    \image qtcreator-screenshot-toolchain.png


    \section2 Creating a Device Configuration

    In order to deploy applications and run them remotely, Qt Creator needs to
    know some parameters for device access. These are set in device
    configurations.

    Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Qt4 >
    \gui{Maemo Device Configurations} and add a new configuration.

    \image qtcreator-screenshot-devconf.png


   \note The password is the one mad developer displays on the device.
   Click \gui Test to check whether the device can be accessed properly. It is
   recommended that you use the password-based login only to deploy your public
   SSH key to the device (using the \gui{Deploy Key} button) and then switch to
   key-based authentication.

   Close the dialog by clicking, the \gui OK button after completion.


   \section2 Setting Build and Run Configuration

   Open a project for an application you want to develop for your N900.
   Click \gui Projects to open the projects mode. In the \gui{Build Settings}
   section, choose the MADDE Qt version which you registered earlier:

   \image qtcreator-screenshot-build-settings.png

   In the \gui{Run Settings} section, click \gui Add to add a new
   run configuration on the maemo device. Set a name and select the device
   configuration you created above in the popup menu. The result is
   shown below:

   \image qtcreator-screenshot-run-settings.png

   \section2 Compiling, Running and Debugging Your Application

   You can now continue your work as you were developing for any other platform
   supported by Qt Creator: For compiling, Qt Creator will use the MADDE
   toolchain's cross compiler. When you run your application, it will be
   automatically copied onto the device and executed there. Your application's
   windows will be displayed on the N900, command-line output can be seen in Qt
   Creator's "Application output" window. Debugging works transparently as well.


   \section1 Deploying the Application On Your Device

    Once you succesfully build and run you application on Qt Creator, you
    can deploy it onto your mobile device. The executable is copied onto the
    device and runs in the same manner on the device as on your PC.

    \title Developing Symbian Applications

    Qt Creator 1.3 comes with preliminary support for development of
    applications using Qt for the Symbian Platform.

    \e{Note that this is highly experimental, and not intended for production use.
    The primary aim is to allow Symbian developers to familiarize themselves with Qt Creator
    and provide feedback that helps us improve Symbian support in future versions of
    Qt Creator.}

    Please provide us with feedback, using the mailing list or IRC, as described on the
    \l{http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/pages/Home}{Qt Creator Development Wiki}.

    \section1 Getting Started with Symbian Based Applications

    You need the following software installed on your PC.
    Only Windows development is supported.

    \list
        \o \l{http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/tools_and_sdks/S60SDK/}
            {S60 Platform SDK 3rd Edition FP1 or higher}
        \o \l{http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/technologies/openc_cpp/}
            {Open C/C++ v1.6.0 or higher} (Install this to all S60 SDKs you plan to use Qt with.
            This is included in the Qt for Symbian binary installers.)
        \o Either the GCCE ARM Toolchain that is included in the S60 Platform SDKs, or
            RVCT 2.2 [build 686] or later (which is not available free of charge)
            (Your environment needs to find the compiler in the PATH.)
        \o Qt for Symbian 4.6.0, installed into the S60 SDKs you want to use

    \endlist

    For deploying and running applications on the device, you need the following:
    \list
        \o The Nokia USB drivers that come e.g. with PC Suite
        \o The \l{http://tools.ext.nokia.com/trk/}{App TRK} application for your device
    \endlist

    Running Qt based applications on real devices requires the following packages to be installed on
    your device. The packages can be found in the S60 SDK where you installed Open C/C++:
    \list
        \o nokia_plugin\\openc\\s60opencsis\\pips_s60_\<version\>.sis
        \o nokia_plugin\\openc\\s60opencsis\\openc_ssl_s60_\<version\>.sis
        \o nokia_plugin\\opencpp\\s60opencppsis\\stdcpp_s60_\<version\>.sis
    \endlist

    If you want to run your applications in the Symbian emulator, you also need to install
    Carbide.c++ v2.0.0 or higher.

    \section1 Setting Up Qt Creator

    When you run Qt Creator after installing the S60 Platform SDK and Qt for Symbian,
    the installed SDKs and their corresponding Qt versions are automatically detected.
    For each detected S60 SDK with Qt, a special entry is made in the Qt version management
    settings \gui{Tools > Options... > Qt4 > Qt Versions}.

    \e{Note that if you manually add a Qt version for Symbian, you must
    also manually specify the S60 SDK to use for this version.}

    \image qtcreator-qt4-qtversions-win-symbian.png

    If you want to run your applications in the Symbian emulator, you need to point Qt Creator
    to the Metrowerks Compiler that you want to use, by setting the \gui{Carbide Directory}
    of the Qt version to the corresponding Carbide.c++ installation directory.

    You can check what S60 SDKs and corresponding Qt versions are found in the
    \gui{Tools > Options... > Qt4 > S60 SDKs} preference page.

    \image qtcreator-qt4-s60sdks.png

    \section1 Building Your Project

    After installing all the prerequisites and checking the setup in Qt Creator as described
    above, you need to set up your project.
    \e{Note that the only supported build system for Qt for Symbian applications in Qt Creator
    is qmake.}

    Before you can build your project for the Symbian platform, you need to create build
    configurations for it.
    Open \gui{Projects mode} and make sure that your project is selected for editing in
    \gui{Edit Project Settings for Project ...}. Add debug and release build configurations
    for the Symbian target by selecting the corresponding Qt version from the build configuration
    \gui{Add} menu.

    \image qtcreator-symbian-add-buildconfiguration.png

    The created build configurations default to using the GCCE tool chain. If you want to build
    for the device using RVCT, or for the Symbian emulator using WINSCW, select \gui{Show Details}
    and change the tool chain in the \gui{General} section of the build configuration settings.

    Now you can switch to building your project for the device by selecting one of the
    new build configurations as the active configuration at the top of \gui{Projects mode}.

    \image qtcreator-symbian-change-buildconfiguration.png

    \section1 Running Your Project

    \section2 Running Your Project in the Emulator

    Similar to the build configuration setup for your project, you need to create a run
    configuration for running your project in the Symbian emulator:
    \list 1
        \o Switch to \gui{Projects mode}.
        \o Select \gui{Run Settings} > \gui{Add > YourApplication in Symbian Emulator}
    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-symbian-add-run-in-emulator.png

    To start your project in the emulator, select this run configuration as the active configuration
    at the top of \gui{Projects mode} window and press the run button.

    \image qtcreator-symbian-change-run-in-emulator.png

    \section2 Running Your Project on the Device

    To run your project on a real Symbian device, just add another run configuration in
    \gui{Projects mode} via \gui{Run Settings} > \gui{Add > YourApplication on Symbian Device}.

    \image qtcreator-symbian-add-runconfiguration.png

    \image qtcreator-symbian-details-runconfiguration.png

    In the details of the run configuration you can specify a certificate to use, and
    select one of the devices that you have currently attached to your computer.
    The only connection mode supported at the moment is USB in \e{PC Suite} mode.
    For actually running your application on the device, you need to set the device run configuration
    as the active configuration at the top of \gui{Projects mode}.
    Start the \gui{App TRK} application on your device and press the run button to create
    a package for your application, deploy, install and run it automatically on your device.

    \image qtcreator-symbian-change-runconfiguration.png

    \section2 Troubleshooting

    If you cannot build the application, check if:
     \list
        \o You selected a Qt version for Symbian for building the application.
        \o The settings for the Qt version you use to build your project are
           correct. The path to the S60 SDK must point to the S60 SDK
           installation directory.  Select \gui Tools > \gui Options...
           > \gui Debugger > \gui{Symbian TRK} and check if it points to the
           debugger toolchain.
     \endlist
    If you cannot run the application in the emulator, check if:
     \list
        \o The emulator or device run configuration selected is in the active
           run configuration.
        \o You built the application for the emulator by using  WINSCW  or for
           the device by using GCCE or RVCT.
        \o The emulator process cannot be started, try closing Qt Creator and
           starting the application directly from your file manager. Having
           done this, Qt Creator should be able to run your projects in the
           emulator.
     \endlist
    If you cannot run the application on a device, check if:
     \list
        \o The device is connected via USB in \e{PC Suite} mode.
        \o App TRK is running on the device, using the USB connection, with the
           status \e connected.
        \o The device is detected and selected in the run configuration
           details.
     \endlist

    If this does not help to solve your problem, search the qt-creator@trolltech.com
    mailing list archives or provide feedback to us via the methods described on the
    \l{http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/pages/Home}{Qt Creator Development Wiki}.

    \title Adding Qt Designer Plugins

     You can use Qt APIs to create plugins that extend Qt applications.
     This allows you to add your own widgets to \QD.
     The most flexible way to include a plugin with an application is to compile it
     into a dynamic library that is shipped separately, and detected and loaded at runtime.

     The applications can detect plugins that are stored in the standard plugin
     subdirectories. For more information on how to create and locate plugins and to
     change the default plugin path, see \l{How to Create Qt Plugins}.

     For more information about how to create plugins for \QD, see
     \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/designer-using-custom-widgets.html}{Creating and Using Components for Qt Designer}.

    \section1 Locating Qt Designer Plugins

     \QD fetches plugins from the standard locations and loads the plugins
     that match its build key. \QD is delivered both as a standalone application
     and as part of an SDK, where it is integrated into Qt Creator.
     The correct folder to place the plugins depends on
     which one you use.

     The integrated \QD fetches plugins from the \c {%SDK%\bin\designer} folder on Windows
     and Linux and \c {QtCreator.app/Contents/MacOS/designer} folder on Mac. To check which plugins
     were loaded successfully and which failed, choose \gui{Tools > Form Editor >
     About Qt Designer Plugins}.

     The standalone \QD is part of the Qt library used for building projects,
     located under \c {%SDK%\qt}. Therefore, it fetches plugins from the following folder:
     \c {%SDK%\qt\plugins\designer}. To check which plugins were loaded successfully and which
     failed, choose \gui{Help > About Plugins}.

     \section1 Matching Build Keys

     The Qt Creator that is included in pre-built SDK packages on Windows is built with the
     Microsoft Visual Studio compiler, whereas the version of Qt shipped for building applications
     is configured and built to use the MinGW/g++ compiler. Plugins built by using this version of
     Qt cannot be loaded by Qt Creator because the build-keys do not match. The plugins can only be
     used in the standalone version of \QD. Choose \gui{Help > About Qt Creator} to check
     the Qt version Qt Creator was built with.

     To use \QD plugins that were built for the shipped Qt version, make sure that
     Qt Creator is built with the same compiler by either recompiling Qt Creator using MinGW or
     recompiling Qt with Microsoft Visual Studio, depending on which configuration you want to
     use for your applications.

    \title Tips and Tricks


    \section1 Switching between modes

    Qt Creator uses different modes for different purposes. You can quickly
    switch between these modes with the following keyboard shortcuts:
    \list
        \o \gui Welcome mode \key Ctrl+1
        \o \gui Edit mode \key Ctrl+2
        \o \gui Debug mode \key Ctrl+3
        \o \gui Projects mode \key Ctrl+4
        \o \gui Help mode \key Ctrl+5
    \endlist


    For more information about Qt Creator modes, see \l {Qt Creator Modes}.



    \section1 Moving Between Open Files

    To quickly move between currently open files, press
    \key Ctrl+Tab.


    \section1 Moving To the Edit Mode

    To move to the \gui Edit mode and currently active file, press
    \key Esc.

    If you already are in the \gui Edit mode:
    \list
        \o The first press moves focus to the editor
        \o The second press closes secondary windows
    \endlist

    \section1 Using the Filter in Options Dialog

    To find specific settings you require in \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options}
    use the filter located at the top left of the Options dialog box.


    \section1 Using Keyboard Shortcuts

    Qt Creator provides \l{Keyboard Shortcuts}{many useful keyboard shortcuts}.

    To customize, import or export keyboard shortcuts, select \gui Tools >
    \gui Options... > \gui Environment > \gui Keyboard.


    \section1 Running Qt Creator From Command Line

    You can launch Qt Creator from command line using the name of an
    existing session or \c .pro file by giving the name as the command
    argument.

    For example, running \tt{qtcreator somesession}, launches Qt Creator and
    loads session somesession.

    \note Make sure Qt Creator is included in the PATH environment variable.
    This can be done by typing the following in the command line:
    \code
    set PATH=c:\qtsdk\mingw\bin;c:\qtsdk\qt\bin;%PATH%
    \endcode


    \section1 Showing and Hiding the Sidebar

    To toggle the sidebar in the \gui Edit and \gui Debug modes, click
    \inlineimage qtcreator-togglebutton.png
    or press \key Alt+0 (\key Cmd+0 on Mac OS X).

    For more information on using the sidebar, see \l {Browsing Project Contents}.



    \section1 Moving To Symbols

    To move straight to a symbol used in a project, select the symbol in the
    \gui Editor toolbar drop-down menu.

    For more information on the editor toolbar,
    see \l {Using the Editor Toolbar}.



    \section1 Displaying Signals and Slots

    If an instance of a class is derived from QObject, and you would like to
    find all other objects connected to one of your object's slots using
    Qt's signals and slots mechanism, select \gui Tools > \gui Options...
    > \gui{Debugging Helper} > \gui{Use Debugging Helper}.

    In the \gui{Locals and Watchers} view, expand the object's entry and open
    the slot in the \e slots subitem. The objects connected to this slot are
    shown as children of the slot. This method works with signals too.


    \section1 Displaying Low Level Data

    If special debugging of Qt objects fails due to data corruption within the
    debugged objects, you can switch off the debugging helpers. When debugging
    helpers are switched off low-level structures become visible.

    To switch off the debugging helpers:
    \list 1
        \o Select \gui Tools > \gui Options... > \gui Debugger >
           \gui{Debugging Helper}.
        \o Uncheck the \gui{Use debugging helper} checkbox.
    \endlist

                shadow building is that it keeps your source directory clean.

    \title Known Issues

    There are some known issues with Qt Creator.
    The development team is aware of them, there is no need to report them as bugs.

    \section1 Known Issues of Version 1.3.82

    \list
        \o Debugging Helper does not work while performing On-Device Debugging.

        \o QML Preview (Run Project) only works if built against Qt with
           Declarative UI.

        \o Setting breakpoints in code that is compiled into the binary more
           than once does not work.

        \o On Linux and Windows, installing Qt with one user account and
        then using it with another requires other users to manually set
        the Qt version. On Windows, setting the MinGW location is
        required as well. The same applies to the location of GDB for Symbian.
        A workaround is to copy %APPDATA%/Nokia/qtcreator.ini (Windows) or
        $HOME/.config/Nokia/QtCreator.ini (Linux) from the directory
        of the user who installed Qt Creator to the other user.
        This issue does not exist on Mac OS X.
    \endlist

    \section1 Known Issues of Version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1

    \list
        \o Gdb on Windows may not work if the 'Embassy \reg Security Center' software
           by 'Wave \reg Systems' is installed and active (causing crashes in \c{vxvault.dll)}).

        \o Only simple data types (POD) work in the Watch Window of CDB.

        \o Qt Creator uses SQLite for storing some of its settings. SQLite is
           known to have problems with certain NFS servers (most notably the
           nfs-user-server 2.2beta), since they can lock up the application
           when it tries to lock the database. If your home directory is on an
           NFS share and you encounter this issue, one option would be to
           switch to the nfs-kernel-server, or create a symlink so that the
           settings are stored locally.
    \endlist

    \section1 Known Issues of Version 1.1.0

    \list
        \o Paths or file names containing spaces or special characters, e.g.,
           colons, dollar signs, hash marks etc. may cause problems. This
           is because some of the tools Qt Creator uses in the background have
           restrictions on the characters allowed in file and directory names.
           To be on the safe side, we recommend creating projects and project
           items with names consisting of plain characters, numbers,
           underscores, and hyphens.

        \o \c{.pro} files are reformatted if files have been added or removed.
           Whitespace is not preserved.

        \o There is no IDE support for adding files to include (\c .pri) files.

        \o There is no IDE support for adding/removing sub-projects. Project
           hierarchies (SUBDIRS template) have to be created manually.

        \o The file system sidebar does not update automatically. As a
           workaround, switch to another directory and then back.

        \o Loading KDE4 designer plugins breaks the style in KDE < 4.2.1
           due to a bug in KDE.

        \o The DEFINES and INCLUDES set in \c{.pro} files are not dealt with
           on a file-specific level. Because of this, handling of DEFINES has
           been disabled completely. Also the \c{.qmake.cache} is not being
           parsed. In general, the \c{.pro} file parser is incomplete and
           problems are still to be expected.

        \o Code completion for generated UI header files is updated only
           after a build.

        \o Code completion does not support typedefs for nested classes.

        \o There is a kernel bug essentially making debugging unreliable on
           2.6.24 kernels for i386 (which is, unfortunately, the default on
           Ubuntu 8.04). See
           \l{https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdb/+bug/230315/} for
           details. The only solution to this problem is to boot another
           kernel.

        \o Gdb may take long to load debugging symbols, especially from large
           libraries like \c libQtWebKit. Starting the debugging module can
           take up to several minutes without visible progress.

        \o Setting breakpoints in files that do not have unique absolute
           paths may fail. For example, remounting parts of a file system
           using the --bind mount option.

        \o There is no syntax highlighting for \c CMake project files.

        \o Project files included from \c{CMakeLists.txt} are not shown in the
           navigation tree.

        \o Using the Visual Studio Compiler with \c CMake is not supported.

        \o Creating new \c CMake projects with Qt Creator is not supported.

        \o Having more than one build directory for \c CMake is not supported.

        \o Changing the build directory for \c CMake after the initial import
           is disabled.
