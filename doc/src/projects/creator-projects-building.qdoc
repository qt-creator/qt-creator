    \title Building for Multiple Platforms

    You can build applications for multiple target platforms, or using different
    compilers,
    debuggers or Qt versions. \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{Kits} define the tools,
    device type and other settings to use.

    By default, when you run the application, you
    automatically build and deploy it first.
    However, you can also perform each operation separately.

    To check that the application code can be compiled and linked for a device,
    you can build the project. The build errors and warnings are displayed in
    the \uicontrol {Issues} output pane. More detailed information is displayed
    in the \uicontrol {Compile Output} pane.

    To build an application:

    \list 1

        \li  Click the \uicontrol {Build and Run Kit Selector} icon (1) or select
             \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Open Build and Run Kit Selector} to select the
             build and run \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit}.

        \image qtcreator-kit-selector.png "Kit selector"

        \li  Choose \uicontrol {Build > Build Project} or press \key {Ctrl+B}.

             You can also select the \uicontrol Run button (2) to also deploy and run
             the application after building it.

    \endlist

    For more information on the options you have, see
    \l{Specifying Build Settings}.

    To quickly check the compile output for changes that you made in one file or
    subproject, you can use the \uicontrol Build menu commands to build a file or
    subproject.

    To remove all build artifacts, select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Clean All} or
    \uicontrol {Clean Project}. To clean the build directory and then build the
    project, select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Rebuild All} or \uicontrol {Rebuild Project}.

    To build and clean projects without dependencies, select the
    \uicontrol {Build Without Dependencies},
    \uicontrol {Rebuild Without Dependencies}, and
    \uicontrol {Clean Without Dependencies} options in the context menu in the
    \uicontrol Projects view.

    To run qmake to generate new Makefiles, select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol qmake.
