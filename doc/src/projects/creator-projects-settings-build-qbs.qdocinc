    \section2 Qbs Build Steps

    \image creator-qbs-build-app.png

    To specify build steps for Qbs:

    \list 1

        \li In the \uicontrol {Build variant} field, select \uicontrol Debug to
            include debug symbols in the build for debugging the application and
            \uicontrol Release to create the final installation file.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Parallel jobs} field, specify the number of
            parallel jobs to use for building.

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Enable QML debugging} check box to debug
            Qt Quick application projects.

            \note Debugging requires opening a socket at a well-known
            port, which presents a security risk. Anyone on the Internet
            could connect to the application that you are debugging and
            execute any JavaScript functions. Therefore, you must make
            sure that the port is properly protected by a firewall.

        \li In the \uicontrol Properties field, specify the properties to pass
            to the project. Use colons (:) to separate keys from values.
            For more information, see
            \l{http://doc.qt.io/qbs/language-introduction.html}
            {Modules} in the Qbs Manual.

        \li In the \uicontrol Flags field:

            \list

                \li Select \uicontrol {Keep going} to continue building when
                    errors occur, if possible.

                \li Select \uicontrol {Show command lines} to print actual
                    command lines to the compile output pane instead of
                    high-level descriptions.

                \li Select \uicontrol {Force probes} to force re-execution of
                    the configure scripts of
                    \l{https://doc.qt.io/qbs/probe-item.html}{Probes}.

                \li Select \uicontrol Install to copy artifacts to their install
                    location after building them. This option is enabled by
                    default.

                    \note On Windows, the build will fail if the application
                    is running, because the executable file cannot be
                    overwritten. To avoid this issue, you can deselect this
                    check box and add a \uicontrol {Qbs Install} deployment step
                    in the run settings that will be performed just before
                    running the application.

                \li Select \uicontrol {Clean install root} to remove the
                    contents of the install root directory before the build
                    starts.

                \li Select \uicontrol {Use default location} to install the
                    artifacts to the default location. Deselect the check box to
                    specify another location in the
                    \uicontrol {Installation directory} field.

            \endlist

    \endlist

    The \uicontrol {Equivalent command line} field displays the build command
    that is constructed based on the selected options.

    \section2 Qbs Clean Steps

    When building with Qbs, you can specify flags in \uicontrol {Clean Steps}:

    \image creator-qbs-build-clean.png

    \list

        \li Select \uicontrol {Dry run} to test cleaning without executing
            commands or making permanent changes to the build graph.

        \li Select \uicontrol {Keep going} to continue cleaning when errors
            occur, if possible.

    \endlist

    The \uicontrol {Equivalent command line} field displays the clean command
    that is constructed based on the selected options.
