    \title Configuring Projects

    When you install Qt for a target platform, such as Android or QNX, the
    build and run settings for the development targets might be set up
    automatically in \QC.

    When you open a project for the first time, the
    \uicontrol {Configure Projects} view is displayed to let you select a set of
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} that you want to use to build and run
    your project. At least one kit must be active for you to be able to build
    and run the project. For more information about selecting the initial kit,
    see \l{Opening Projects}.

    To maintain the list of active kits for a currently open project, switch to
    the \uicontrol Projects mode by pressing \key Ctrl+5.

    \section1 Activating Kits for a Project

    All kits compatible with your project are listed in the
    \uicontrol {Build & Run} section of the sidebar. To activate one or more
    disabled kits, click them.

    The list displays kits that are configured in \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits. If the kit configuration is not
    suitable for the project type, warning and error icons are displayed.
    To view the warning and error messages, move the mouse pointer over
    the kit name.

    To modify kit configuration or to add kits to the list, select
    \uicontrol {Manage Kits}. For more information about managing kits, see
    \l{Adding Kits}.

    Each kit consists of a set of values that define one environment, such as a
    \l{glossary-device}{device}, compiler, and Qt version. For more information,
    see \l{Adding Qt Versions}, \l{Adding Compilers}, and \l{Adding Debuggers}.

    To copy the build and run settings for a kit to another kit, select
    \uicontrol {Copy Steps from Other Kit} in the context menu.

    To deactivate a kit, select \uicontrol {Disable Kit for Project} in the
    context menu.

    \note Deactivating a kit removes all custom build and run settings for the
    kit.

    To import an existing build for the project, select
    \uicontrol {Import Existing Build}.

    \section1 Specifying Settings

    To specify build or run settings for a kit, select \uicontrol Build or
    \uicontrol Run below the kit. For more information, see
    \l{Specifying Build Settings} and \l{Specifying Run Settings}.

    In addition, you can modify the following global settings for each project:

            \list

                \li \l{Specifying Editor Settings}{Editor}

                \li \l{Specifying Code Style Settings}{Code Style}

                \li \l{Specifying Dependencies}{Dependencies}

                \li \l{Parsing C++ Files with the Clang Code Model}
                    {Clang Code Model}

                \li \l{Using Clang Tools}{Clang Tools}

                \li \l{To-Do Entries}{To-Do} (experimental)

            \endlist

    If you have multiple projects open in \QC, select the project to configure
    in the list of projects.
