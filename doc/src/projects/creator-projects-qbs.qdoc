    \title Setting Up Qbs

    To use Qbs to build a project, you must create a .qbs file for the project.
    You can use \QC to create a C or C++ project that is built with Qbs.
    For more information about Qbs, see
    the \l{http://doc.qt.io/qbs/index.html}{Qbs Manual}.

    The application is built using the default Qbs profile that is associated
    with the build and run kit. \QC automatically creates a Qbs profile for each
    kit. You can edit the build profiles by adding new keys and values.

    To check which Qbs version is being used, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits > \uicontrol Qbs.

    \section1 Building Qbs

    If you build \QC yourself from the \QC Git repository, you also need to
    fetch the Qbs submodule to get Qbs support:

    \list 1

        \li Fetch the Qbs submodule in your \QC git checkout with
            \c {git submodule update --init}.

        \li Run qmake on \QC and build \QC again.

    \endlist

    \section1 Specifying Qbs Settings

    To specify settings for Qbs, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol Kits > \uicontrol Qbs.

    By default, Qbs profiles are stored in the \c qbs directory in the \QC
    settings directory to ensure that different \QC instances do not overwrite
    each other's profiles. If you only run one \QC instance, you can store the
    profiles in the Qbs settings directory instead, by deselecting the
    \uicontrol {Store profiles in Qt Creator settings directory} check box.

    In the \uicontrol Kit field, select a build and run kit to view the
    properties of the associated Qbs profile. To modify the properties of the
    Qbs profile associated with a kit, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits. For more
    information, see \l{Editing Qbs Profiles}.
