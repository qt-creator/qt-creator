    \title Building and Running an Example

    You can test that your \QSDK installation is successful by opening an existing
    example application project.

    To run an example application on an Android or iOS device, you must set up
    the development environment for Android or iOS. For more information, see
    \l{Connecting Android Devices} and \l{Connecting iOS Devices}.

    To run an example application on an embedded device, you must set up
    Qt for Device Creation on the development host and create connections
    between the host and devices. For more information, see the
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtee-installation-guide.html}
    {Installation Guide} in the
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/index.html}{Qt for Device Creation}
    documentation.

    \list 1

        \li In the \uicontrol Welcome mode, select \uicontrol Examples (1).

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-open.png "Selecting an example"

            If no examples are listed, check that a \l{Adding Qt Versions}
            {Qt version} is installed and configured.

        \li Select an example in the list of examples.

            You can also search for examples. Enter the \uicontrol android or
            \uicontrol ios keyword in the search field (2) to list all the
            examples tested for Android or iOS. To list examples that you can
            run on embedded devices, enter the \uicontrol Boot2Qt keyword in the
            search field (commercial only).

        \li To check that the application code can be compiled and linked for a
            device, click the \uicontrol {Kit Selector} and select a
            \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} for the
            device.

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-kit-selector.png "Selecting a kit to build with"

            If you installed \QC as part of a Qt installation, it should have
            automatically detected the installed kit. If no kits are available,
            see \l{Adding Kits}.

        \li Click \inlineimage run_small.png
            (\uicontrol Run) to build and run the application.

        \li To see the compilation progress, press \key{Alt+4} to open the
            \uicontrol {Compile Output} pane.

            If build errors occur, check that a Qt version and
            \l{Adding Compilers}{compiler} are installed and
            configured and that the necessary kits are configured. If you are
            building for an \l{Connecting Android Devices}{Android device} or
            \l{Connecting iOS Devices}{iOS device}, check that the development
            environment has been set up correctly.

            The \uicontrol Build progress bar on the toolbar turns green when the
            project is successfully built. The application opens on the device.
