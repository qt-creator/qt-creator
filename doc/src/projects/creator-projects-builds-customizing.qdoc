    \title  Customizing the Build Process

    To specify the relationship between the release, build,
    and deploy configurations, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol {Build & Run}. By
    default, the \uicontrol {Always build project before deploying it} and the
    \uicontrol {Always deploy project before running it} options (1) are enabled.
    Therefore, when you select the \uicontrol Run function, \QC checks for changes in
    the project files and also builds and deploys the project if necessary.

    On Windows, you can use \c jom instead of \c nmake for building the project
    to distribute the compilation process to multiple CPU cores. You can download
    \c jom from \l{http://download.qt.io/official_releases/jom}{Qt Downloads}.
    To use \c jom, select the \uicontrol {Use jom instead of nmake} check box.
    Deselect the check box if you experience build problems.

    You can specify the default build directory  in the
    \uicontrol {Default build directory} field using \QC variables (2).
