    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for Desktop Device Types

    You can specify command line arguments to be passed to the executable
    and the working directory to use. The working directory defaults to
    the directory of the build result.

    For console applications, check the \uicontrol{Run in Terminal} check box.
    If you need to run with special environment variables set up, you
    also do it in the run configuration settings.

    The \uicontrol {Use debug version of frameworks (DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_debug)} option
    (only available on OS X) enables you to debug (for example, step into)
    linked frameworks, such as the Qt framework itself. You do not need this
    option for debugging your application code.

    You can also create custom executable run configurations where you
    can set the executable to be run. For more information, see
    \l{Specifying a Custom Executable to Run}.
