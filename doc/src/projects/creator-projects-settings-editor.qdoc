    \title Specifying Editor Settings

    \QC uses the \l{Editing MIME Types}{MIME type} of the file to
    determine which mode and editor to use for opening the file. For example,
    \QC opens .txt files in \uicontrol Edit mode in the text editor.

    You can configure the text editor according to your needs. You can specify
    editor behavior either globally for all projects or separately for each
    project. To specify global editor behavior, select \uicontrol {Tools > Options
    > Text Editor > Behavior}.

    To configure the text editor behavior for the current project:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Project Settings} >
            \uicontrol Editor.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Editor settings} field, select \uicontrol {Custom}.

        \li Specify text editor settings for the project.

    \endlist

    Click \uicontrol {Restore Global} to revert to the global settings.

        \li \l{File Encoding}

        \li \l{Moving to Symbol Definition or Declaration}

        \li \l{Configuring Fonts}

        \li \l{Highlighting and Folding Blocks}

        \li \l{Viewing Function Tooltips}
