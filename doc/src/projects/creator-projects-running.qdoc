    \title Running on Multiple Platforms

    By default, running an application also builds it and deploys it to a
    location from where it can be run on the desktop, on a device emulator or
    simulator, or on a \l{glossary-device}{device} that is connected to
    the development PC.

    To run executable files without deploying them first, select \uicontrol Build >
    \uicontrol {Run Without Deployment}. To make this the default option, deselect the
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Project >
    \uicontrol {Always deploy project before running it} option.

    To run applications:

    \list 1

        \li Click the \uicontrol {Build and Run Kit Selector} icon (1) or select
            \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Open Build and Run Kit Selector} to select the
            build and run \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit}.

        \li Click the \uicontrol Run button (2).

    \endlist

    The \uicontrol {Application Output} pane displays the status of the
    application while it is running. You can select the \uicontrol Run button
    in the pane to re-run applications without building them first. This is
    useful when developing Qt Quick applications, because the QML files are
    interpreted at runtime. Therefore, the application does not need to be
    built again if you edited only QML files. This saves time especially if
    the application contains large image files that would need to be bundled
    into the resource file before running the application.

    \l{Specifying Run Settings}.
