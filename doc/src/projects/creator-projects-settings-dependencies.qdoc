    \title Specifying Dependencies

    If you have multiple projects loaded in a session, you can define the
    order in which they are built. For example, if project A depends on project
    B, project B must be built first.

    \note The build order is stored as a property of a session, not a project.
    You must open the session for these settings to take effect. For more
    information, see \l{Managing Sessions}.

    \image qtcreator-build-dependencies.png "Dependencies view"

    To define the build order of projects within a session:

    \list 1

        \li In \uicontrol Projects, select a project.

        \li Click \uicontrol Dependencies.

        \li Select projects that must be built before the current project is
            built.

    \endlist

    \QC calculates the build order based on the dependencies that you
    specify for the projects loaded in the session.

    \note You cannot use this view to specify subprojects for projects.
    For more information on how to add subprojects, see \l{Adding Subprojects
    to Projects}.
