    \title Adding Kits

    \QC groups settings used for building and running projects as kits
    to make cross-platform and cross-configuration development easier. Each kit
    consists of a set of values that define one environment, such as a
    \l{glossary-device}{device}, compiler, Qt version, and debugger command
    to use, and some metadata, such as an icon and a name for the kit. Once
    you have defined kits, you can select them to build and run projects.

    \QC supports development for the desktop and for the following types of
    devices:

    \list

        \li Android Device

        \li Bare Metal Device

        \li Generic Linux Device

        \li iOS Device

        \li iOS Simulator

        \li QNX Device

    \endlist

    To add kits:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits >
            \uicontrol Add.

            \image qtcreator-kits.png

            To clone the selected kit, select \uicontrol Clone.

        \li In the \uicontrol Name column, enter a name for the kit.

        \li Select the \inlineimage qtcreator-desktopdevice-button.png
            button to select an image to use as an icon for the kit.

        \li In the \uicontrol {File system name} field, enter a name for the kit
            to use as a part of directory names. This value is used for the
            \e CurrentKit:FileSystemName variable, which determines the name of
            the shadow build directory, for example.

        \li In the \uicontrol{Device type} field, select the type of the device.

            Double-click the icon next to the field to select the image that is
            displayed in the kit selector for this kit. You can use any
            image in a supported file format (for example, PNG). The image is
            scaled to the size 64x64 pixels. For example, using the compiler
            logo as an icon allows you to easily see, which compiler is used to
            build the project for the selected kit.

        \li In the \uicontrol Device field, select a device.

        \li In the \uicontrol Sysroot field, specify the directory where the device
            image is located. If you are not cross-compiling, leave this field
            empty.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Compiler} field, select the C or C++ compiler
            used to build the project. You can add compilers to the list
            if they are installed on the development PC, but were not detected
            automatically. For more information, see \l{Adding Compilers}.

        \li In the \uicontrol Environment field, select \uicontrol Change to modify
            environment variable values for build environments in
            the \uicontrol {Edit Environment Changes} dialog. For more information
            about how to add and remove variable values, see \l{Batch Editing}.

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Force UTF-8 MSVC compiler output} check box
            to either switch the language of MSVC to English or to keep the
            language setting and just force UTF-8 output, depending on the
            MSVC compiler used.

        \li In the \uicontrol Debugger field, select the debugger to debug the project
            on the target platform. \QC automatically detects available
            debuggers and displays a suitable debugger in the field. You can
            add debuggers to the list. For more information, see
            \l{Adding Debuggers}.

            For Android kits, the \uicontrol {Android GDB server} field will
            display the path to GDB server executable.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Qt version} field, select the Qt version to use for
            building the project. You can add Qt versions to the list if they
            are installed on the development PC, but were not detected
            automatically. For more information, see \l{Adding Qt Versions}.

            \QC checks the directories listed in the \c{PATH} environment
            variable for the qmake executable. If a qmake executable is found,
            it is referred to as \b{Qt in PATH} and selected as the Qt
            version to use for the \uicontrol Desktop kit that is created by default.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Qt mkspec} field, specify the name of the mkspec
            configuration that should be used by qmake. If you leave this field
            empty, the default mkspec of the selected Qt version is used.

        \li In the \uicontrol {CMake Tool} field, select the CMake tool to use
            for building the project. Select \uicontrol Manage to add installed
            CMake tools to the list. For more information, see
            \l{Adding CMake Tools}.

        \li In the \uicontrol {CMake generator} field, select \uicontrol Change
            to edit the CMake
            Generator to use for producing project files. Only the generators
            with names beginning with the string \uicontrol CodeBlocks produce
            all the necessary data for the \QC code model. \QC displays a
            warning if you select a generator that is not supported.

        \li In the \uicontrol {CMake configuration} field, select
            \uicontrol Change to edit the variables of the CMake configuration
            for the kit.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Additional Qbs profile settings} field, select
            \uicontrol Change to add settings to Qbs build profiles. For more
            information, see \l {Editing Qbs Profiles}.

    \endlist

    \QC uses the \e {default kit} if it does not have enough information to
    choose the kit to use. To set the selected kit as the default kit,
    select \uicontrol {Make Default}.

    \section1 Editing Qbs Profiles

    To view the Qbs profile associated with the kit, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits > \uicontrol Qbs.

    You can add keys and values to the profile or remove them from it, as well
    as modify existing values. For a list of available keys and values, see
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/qbs/list-of-modules.html}{List of Modules} in the Qbs
    Manual.

    To edit the Qbs profile associated with the kit:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Change next to the
            \uicontrol {Additional Qbs Profile Settings} field.

            \image qtcreator-qbs-profile-settings.

        \li Select \uicontrol Add.

        \li In the \uicontrol Key column, spefify the key to add or modify as:
            \c <module_name>.<property_name>.

        \li In the \uicontrol Value column, specify a value as a JSON literal.

        \li Click \uicontrol OK.

    \endlist

    To modify an existing value, double-click it in the \uicontrol Value field.

    To remove the selected property, select \uicontrol Remove.
