    \title Specifying Code Style Settings

    \QC uses the \l{Editing MIME Types}{MIME type} of the file to
    determine which mode and editor to use for opening the file.
    \QC opens C++ files in \gui Edit mode in the C++ code editor and
    QML files in the Qt Quick editor.

    You can configure the code style according to your needs. You can specify
    code style either globally for all projects or separately for each
    project. You can specify several sets of code style settings and easily
    switch between them. In addition, you can import and export code style
    settings.

    To specify global code style settings sets for C++ files, select
    \gui {Tools > Options > C++}.

    To specify global code style settings sets for QML files, select \gui {Tools
    > Options > Qt Quick}.

    To configure the editor behavior for the current project:

    \list 1

        \o  Select \gui {Projects > Code Style Settings}.

        \o  In the \gui Language field, select \gui C++ or \gui {Qt Quick}.

        \o  In the \gui {Current settings} field, select the settings to modify
            and click \gui Copy.

        \o  Give a name to the settings and click \gui OK.

        \o  Click \gui Edit to specify code style settings for the project.
