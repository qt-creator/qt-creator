    \title Adding Qt Versions

    \QC allows you to have multiple versions of Qt installed on your development
    PC and use different versions to build your projects.
    For example, device manufacturers provide special Qt versions for developing
    applications for their devices.

    \QC automatically detects the Qt versions that are registered by
    your system or by installers. To view detailed information for each Qt
    version, select it in the list and select \uicontrol Details in the
    \uicontrol {Qt version for} section. To add Qt versions, select
    \uicontrol {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions}.

    You specify the Qt version to use for each \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}
    {kit} for building and running your projects
    in \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol {Build & Run} > \uicontrol Kits.

    \section2 Setting Up New Qt Versions

    To add a Qt version:

        \list 1

            \li Select \uicontrol {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions > Add}.

            \li Select the qmake executable for the Qt version that you want to
                add.

            \li Select the Qt version to view and edit it.

            \li In the \uicontrol{Version name} field, edit the name that \QC
                suggests for the Qt version.

            \li In the \uicontrol{qmake location} field, you can change the qmake
                location.

            \li In the \uicontrol Helpers section, select \uicontrol Details to view the
                QML Dumper that has been built for the Qt version. For more
                information, see \l{Using Debugging Helpers}.

                \image qt-creator-debugging-helpers.png

            \li If the Qt version is for QNX, enter the path to your installed QNX SDK in the
                \uicontrol{QNX SDK} field.

        \endlist

    \section2 Minimum Requirements
    If your build of Qt is incomplete but you still want to use QMake as build
    system, you need to ensure the following minimum requirements to be able to use that setup with \QC.
    \list 1
        \li qmake is an executable that understands the -query command line argument.
        \li The bin and include directories have to exist. \QC fetches these directories by running \c{qmake -query}.
        \li The mkspecs directory should be complete enough to parse .pro files.
    \endlist

    If your Qt version has no libQtCore.so, \QC is unable to detect the ABI.
