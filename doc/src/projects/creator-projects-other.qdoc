    \title Using Other Build Systems

    Most \QC project wizards create projects that are configured to use qmake. Most
    of the instructions in this manual apply to using qmake. However, \QC is
    also integrated to other build systems, as described in the the following
    sections:

    \list

        \li \l{Setting Up a CMake Project}

            CMake is an alternative to qmake for automating the generation of
            build configurations.

        \li \l{Setting Up a Qbs Project}

            Qt Build Suite (Qbs) is an all-in-one build
            tool that generates a build graph from a high-level project
            description (like qmake or CMake do) and executes the commands in
            the low-level build graph (like make does).

        \li \l{Setting Up an Autotools Project}

            \QC can open projects that use the Autotools build system. You can
            build and run the projects directly from \QC.

        \li \l{Setting Up a Generic Project}

            \QC supports generic projects, so you can import existing projects
            that do not use qmake or CMake. This enables you to use \QC as a
            code editor and to fully control the steps and commands used to
            build the project.
