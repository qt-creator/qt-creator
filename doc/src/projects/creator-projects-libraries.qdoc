    \title Adding Libraries to Projects

    In addition to Qt libraries, you can add other libraries to your projects.
    The way the library is added depends on the type and location of the
    library. You can add a system library, your own library, or a 3rd party
    library. The library can be located either in the build tree of the
    current project or in another build tree.

    Because system libraries do not typically change and are often found by
    default, you do not need to specify the path to the library or to its
    includes when you add it. You can use \c{pkg-config} to query system
    libraries during compilation.

    For your own libraries and 3rd party libraries, you need to specify
    the paths. \QC tries to guess the include path for an external library,
    but you need to check it and modify it if necessary. \QC automatically
    adds the include path for an internal library.

    For all libraries, select the target platforms for the application, library,
    or plugin.

    Specify whether the library is statically or dynamically linked. For a
    statically linked internal library, \QC adds dependencies
    (PRE_TARGETDEPS) in the project file.

    Depending on the development platform, some options might be detected
    automatically. For example, on OS X, the library type (\uicontrol Library or
    \uicontrol Framework) is detected automatically and the option is hidden. However,
    if you develop on another platform than OS X and want to build your
    project for OS X, you must specify the library type.

    The default convention on Windows is that the debug and release versions
    of a library have the same name, but are placed in different subdirectories,
    usually called \e debug and \e release. If the library path does not contain
    either of these folders, you cannot select the option to place the libraries
    in separate folders.

    Alternatively, the letter \e d can be added to the library name for the
    debug version. For example, if the release version is called example.lib,
    the debug version is called exampled.lib. You can specify that the letter
    is added for the debug version and removed for the release version.
    If the library name ends in \e d, deselect the \uicontrol {Remove "d" suffix
    for release version} option.

    \QC supports code completion and syntax highlighting for the added
    libraries once your project successfully builds and links to them.

    \section1 To Add Libraries

    \list 1

        \li In the \uicontrol Projects pane, right-click the project name to open the
            context menu and select
            \uicontrol {Add Library}.

        \li Follow the instructions of the wizard.

    \endlist

    For more information about the project file settings, see
    \l{Declaring Other Libraries}.

    \section1 Example of Adding Internal Libraries

    The following example describes how to add a statically linked internal
    library to your project.

    \list 1

        \li Choose \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File or Project} >
            \uicontrol Library > \uicontrol {C++ Library} to create the library.

            The \uicontrol {Introduction and Product Location} dialog opens.

            \image qtcreator-add-library-wizard-ex-1.png "Introduction and Product Location dialog"

        \li In the \uicontrol Type field, select \uicontrol {Statically Linked Library}.

        \li In the \uicontrol Name field, give a name for the library. For example,
            \b mylib.

        \li Follow the instructions of the wizard until you get to the
            \uicontrol {Project Management} dialog. In the \uicontrol {Add to project}
            list, select a project. For example, \b myapp.

        \li In the \uicontrol Projects pane, right-click the project name to open the
            context menu and select
            \uicontrol {Add Library > Internal Library > Next}.

        \li In the \uicontrol Library field, select \b mylib and click \uicontrol Next.

        \li Click \uicontrol Finish to add the following library declaration to the
            project file:

            \code
            win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$OUT_PWD/../../../projects/mylib/release/ -lmylib
            else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$OUT_PWD/../../../projects/mylib/debug/ -lmylib
            else:unix: LIBS += -L$$OUT_PWD/../../../projects/mylib/ -lmylib

            INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../../../projects/mylib
            DEPENDPATH += $$PWD/../../../projects/mylib

            win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): PRE_TARGETDEPS += $$OUT_PWD/../../../projects/mylib/release/mylib.lib
            else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): PRE_TARGETDEPS += $$OUT_PWD/../../../projects/mylib/debug/mylib.lib
            else:unix: PRE_TARGETDEPS += $$OUT_PWD/../../../projects/mylib/libmylib.a
            \endcode

    \endlist
