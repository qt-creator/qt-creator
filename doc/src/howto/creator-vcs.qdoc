    \endtable

    \section1 Setting Up Version Control Systems

    \QC uses the version control system's command line clients to access your
    repositories. To allow access, make sure that the command line clients can
    be located using the \c{PATH} environment variable or specify the path to
    the command line client executables in \uicontrol{Tools} > \uicontrol{Options} >
    \uicontrol {Version Control}.

    After you set up the version control system, use the command line to check
    that everything works (for example, use the status command). If no issues
    arise, you should be ready to use the system also from \QC.

    \section2 Using msysGit on Windows

    If you configure Git for use with \c {git bash}, only, and use SSH
    authorization, Git looks for the SSH keys in the directory where the
    \c HOME environment points to. The variable is always set by \c {git bash}.

    However, the variable is typically not set in a Windows command prompt. When
    you run Git from a Windows command prompt, it looks for the SSH keys in its
    installation directory, and therefore, the authorization fails.

    You can set the \c HOME environment variable from \QC. Select \uicontrol {Tools >
    Options > Version Control > Git}. Select the \uicontrol {Environment Variables}
    and the \uicontrol {Set "HOME" environment variable} check boxes. \c HOME is set
    to \c %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% when the Git executable is run and authorization
    works as it would with \c {git bash}.

    \section1 Setting Up General Options

    Select \uicontrol{Tools} > \uicontrol{Options} > \uicontrol{Version Control}
    > \uicontrol{General}
    to specify settings for submit messages:

    \list

        \li \uicontrol{Submit message check script} is a script or program that
            can be used to perform checks on the submit message before
            submitting. The submit message is passed in as the script's first
            parameter. If there is an error, the script should output a
            message on standard error and return a non-zero exit code.

        \li \uicontrol{User/alias configuration file} is a text file that lists
            author names in mailmap format. For each author, you must specify a
            real name and email address and optionally an alias and a second
            email address. For example:

            \code
            Jon Doe <Jon.Doe@company.com> jdoe <jdoe@somemail.com>
            Hans Mustermann <Hans.Mustermann@company.com> hm <info@company.com>
            \endcode

            After you specify a file in this field, you can select authors
            as values of the submit message fields in the \uicontrol Nicknames dialog.

        \li \uicontrol{User fields configuration file} is a simple text file
            consisting of lines specifying submit message fields that take
            authors as values, for example:

            \code
            Acked-by:
            Initial-patch-by:
            Reported-by:
            Rubber-stamped-by:
            Signed-off-by:
            Tested-by:
            \endcode

            After you specify a file in this field, you can add authors as
            values of the submit message fields when submitting changes. If
            you also specified a \uicontrol{User/alias configuration file}, you can
            select authors in the \uicontrol Nicknames dialog.

        \li \uicontrol{SSH prompt command} specifies an ssh-askpass command that you
            can use (on Linux) to prompt the user for a password when using SSH.
            For example, \c ssh-askpass or \c x11-ssh-askpass, depending on the
            ssh-askpass implementation that you use.

        \li \uicontrol {Patch command} specifies the path to the patch utility that is
            used to apply changes in the format used to represent the diff
            output. The \uicontrol Revert command uses the patch utility to revert
            partial changes.

    \endlist

    \section1 Creating VCS Repositories for New Projects

    \QC allows you to create repositories for version control systems that
    support local repository creation, such as Git, Mercurial, or Bazaar.
    When creating a new project by selecting \uicontrol File > \uicontrol{New File or
    Project}, you can choose a version control system on the final wizard page.

    You can also select \uicontrol Tools and then select \uicontrol {Create Repository}
    in the submenu for the version control system.

    To import a project that is under version control, choose \uicontrol {File >
    New File or Project > Project from Version Control} and select the
    version control system that you use. Follow the instructions of the
    wizard to import the project.

    \section1 Using Version Control Systems

    The \uicontrol{Tools} menu contains a submenu for each supported version
    control system.

    The \uicontrol{Version Control} output pane displays the commands that are
    executed, a timestamp, and the relevant output. Select \uicontrol {Window > Output
    Panes > Version Control} to open the pane.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-pane.png

    \section2 Adding Files

    When you create a new file or a new project, the wizard displays a page
    asking whether the files should be added to a version control system.
    This happens when the parent directory or the project is already
    under version control and the system supports the concept of adding files,
    for example, Perforce and Subversion. Alternatively, you can
    add files later by using the version control tool menus.

    With Git, there is no concept of adding files. Instead, all modified
    files must be staged for a commit.

    \section2 Viewing Diff Output

    All version control systems provide menu options to \e{diff} the current
    file or project: to compare it with the latest version stored in the
    repository and to display the differences. In \QC, a diff is displayed in a
    read-only editor. If the file is accessible, you can double-click on a
    selected diff chunk and \QC opens an editor displaying the file, scrolled to
    the line in question.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-diff.png

    With Git and Subversion, the diff is displayed side-by-side in a \l{Comparing Files}
    {diff editor} by default. To use the inline diff view instead, select the
    \uicontrol {Switch to Text Diff Editor} option from the toolbar. In the inline
    diff view, you can use context menu commands to apply, revert, stage, and
    unstage hunks, as well as send them to a code pasting service.

    \section3 Using GNU Diffutils with ClearCase

    You can use the GNU Diffutils tool With ClearCase to compare files and
    activities:

    \list 1

        \li Download \l{http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm}
            {Diffutils} and extract it to a directory in your PATH.

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
            \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol ClearCase.

        \li Select the \uicontrol External radio button. The radio button is
            disabled if \c diff is not found in the PATH.

        \li In the \uicontrol Arguments field, specify arguments for running
            \c diff.

    \endlist

    \section2 Viewing Versioning History and Change Details

    Display the versioning history of a file by selecting \uicontrol{Log}
    or \uicontrol{Filelog}. Typically, the log output contains the date, the commit
    message, and a change or revision identifier. Click on the identifier to
    display a description of the change including the diff.
    Right-clicking on an identifier brings up a context menu that lets you
    show annotation views of previous versions (see \l{Annotating Files}).
    With Git you can also choose to cherry-pick or revert a change.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-log.png

    \section2 Annotating Files

    Annotation views are obtained by selecting \uicontrol{Annotate} or \uicontrol{Blame}.
    Selecting \uicontrol{Annotate} or \uicontrol{Blame} displays the lines of the file
    prepended by the change identifier they originate from. Clicking on the
    change identifier shows a detailed description of the change.

    To show the annotation of a previous version, right-click on the
    version identifier at the beginning of a line and choose one of the
    revisions shown at the bottom of the context menu. This allows you to
    navigate through the history of the file and obtain previous versions of
    it. It also works for Git and Mercurial using SHA-1.

    The same context menu is available when right-clicking on a version
    identifier in the file log view of a single file.

    \section2 Committing Changes

    Once you have finished making changes, submit them to the version control
    system by choosing \uicontrol{Commit} or \uicontrol{Submit}. \QC displays a
    commit page containing a text editor where you can enter your commit
    message and a checkable list of modified files to be included.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-commit.png

    When you have finished filling out the commit page information, click on
    \uicontrol{Commit} to start committing.

    The \uicontrol{Diff Selected Files} button brings up a diff view of the
    files selected in the file list. Since the commit page is just another
    editor, you can go back to it by closing the diff view. You can also switch
    to an open diff view by selecting it in the \uicontrol{Open Documents} pane in the
    sidebar.

    \section2 Reverting Changes

    All supported version control systems support reverting your project to
    known states. This functionality is generally called \e reverting.

    The changes discarded depend on the version control system.

    A version control system can replace the \uicontrol Revert menu option with other
    options.

    \section3 Reverting Changes Using Git

    The Git version control system has an index that is used to stage
    changes. The index is committed on the next commit. Git allows you to revert
    back to the state of the last commit as well as to the state staged in the
    index.

    \list

        \li \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Current File} > \uicontrol{Undo Unstaged Changes} reverts
            all changes and resets the current file to the state of the
            index.

        \li \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Current File} > \uicontrol {Undo Uncommitted Changes}
            reverts all changes, discarding the
            index. This returns the current file to the state it was in right
            after the last commit.

        \li \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol Reset opens a dialog
            where you can select the SHA-1 to reset the working directory to.
            This is useful after applying patches for review, for example. You
            can choose between a \uicontrol Soft reset that does not touch the index
            file nor the working tree at all, a \uicontrol Hard reset that discards
            all changes to tracked files in working tree, and a \uicontrol Mixed
            reset that resets HEAD and the index (nothing remains staged)
            without touching the working directory.

    \endlist

    \section2 Viewing Status

    You can select \uicontrol{Status} to view the status of the project or
    repository.

    \section2 Updating the Working Tree

    You can select \uicontrol Update to update your working tree with the latest
    changes from the branch. Some version control systems allow you to choose
    between updating the current project and updating all projects.

    With Git, you stash your changes and then pull the changes from the
    repository.

    \section2 Deleting Files

    You can select \uicontrol Delete to delete obsolete files from the repository.

    With Git, you delete the files from the working tree and then stage the
    deleted files for a commit.

    \section2 Using Additional Bazaar Functions

    Bazaar is a free version control system sponsored by Canonical.

    The \uicontrol Bazaar submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Pull
            \li Turn the branch into a mirror of another branch.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Push
            \li Update a mirror of the branch.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Uncommit
            \li Remove the last committed revision.
    \endtable

    \section3 Uncommitting Revisions

    In Bazaar, committing changes to a branch creates a new revision that holds
    a snapshot of the state of the working tree. To remove the last committed
    revision, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Bazaar > \uicontrol Uncommit.

    In the \uicontrol Uncommit dialog, select options to keep tags that point to
    removed revisions and to only remove the commits from the local branch when
    in a checkout.

    To remove all commits up to an entry in the revision log, specify the
    revision in the \uicontrol Revision field.

    To test the outcome of the \uicontrol Uncommit command without actually removing
    anything, select \uicontrol {Dry Run}.

    \uicontrol Uncommit leaves the working tree ready for a new commit. The only
    change it might make is restoring pending merges that were present before
    the commit.

    \section2 Using Additional ClearCase Functions

    IBM Rational ClearCase is a version control, workspace management, parallel
    development support, and build automation solution developed by IBM. The
    ClearCase client plugin is available on Linux and Windows for accessing a
    ClearCase server.

    The \uicontrol ClearCase submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Check In}
            \li Create a permanent new version of the current file or all files
                in the versioned object base (VOB).
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Check In Activity}
            \li Check in checked-out versions in the change set of the current
                Unified Change Management (UCM) activity.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Check Out}
            \li Create a writable copy of a branch. If you check out files in a
                UCM view, they are added to the change set of the UCM activity.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Undo Check Out}
            \li Cancel the checkout for a file and delete the checked-out
                version.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Undo Hijack}
            \li Resolve hijacked files. If you change the read-only attribute of
                a file that is loaded into a snapshot view and modify the file
                without checking it out, you \e hijack the file.
    \endtable

\section2 Using Additional CVS Functions

    CVS is an open source version control system.

    In addition to the standard version control system functions, you can
    select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol CVS > \uicontrol Edit to open a file for editing.
    To discard the changes that you made in a file, select \uicontrol Unedit.

    \section2 Using Additional Git Functions

    Git is a fast decentralized version control system. Git is available
    for Windows, Linux and Mac.

    You can use the \l{http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/}{Gerrit} code review
    tool for projects that use Git.

    \section3 Working with the Current File

    In addition to the standard version control system functions, you can
    select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Current File} >
    \uicontrol {Stage File for
    Commit} to mark a new or modified file for committing to the repository.

    To undo this function, select \uicontrol {Unstage File from Commit}.

    \section3 Working with the Current Project

    In addition to the standard version control system functions, you can
    select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Current Project} >
    \uicontrol {Clean Project}
    to clean the working directory. All files that are not under version control
    are displayed in the \uicontrol {Clean Repository} dialog. Ignored files are
    deselected by default. Select the files to delete and click \uicontrol Delete.

    \section3 Working with Local Repositories

    In addition to the standard version control system functions, you can
    select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository} >
    \uicontrol Clean to clean
    the repository.

    To apply latest changes to the last commit, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git >
    \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol {Amend Last Commit}. You can also edit the
    commit message.

    To amend an earlier comment in a series of related commits, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository} >
    \uicontrol {Fixup Previous Commit}. This operation is done using interactive
    rebase. In case of conflicts, a merge tool is suggested.

    To change a series of commits in the local repository, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol {Interactive Rebase}. You can
    reorder or discard commits, squash them into a single commit, or edit the
    commit messages.

    The following sections describe how to manage local and remote branches,
    apply patches, and use stashes.

    \section4 Working with Branches

    To work with Git branches, select \uicontrol{Branches}. The checked out branch
    is shown in bold and underlined in the list of branches. Double-click branch
    names to edit them.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-gitbranch.png "Branches dialog"

    The following operations are supported:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Refresh}
            \li Refresh the list of branches.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Add}
            \li Create new tracking and non-tracking branches.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Remove}
            \li Remove a local branch. You cannot delete remote branches.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Rename
            \li Rename a local branch.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Checkout}
            \li Check out the selected branch and make it current. You can stash
                changes you have made to tracked files.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Diff}
            \li Show the differences between the selected and the current
                branch.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Log}
            \li Show the changes in a branch.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Merge
            \li Join the development histories in two branches together.

                If the commit you are merging can be reached by following the
                first commit's history, there is no divergent work to merge
                together. To allow Git to move the branch pointer forward,
                select \uicontrol {Fast-Forward}. If you do not want to fast-forward
                the branch, select \uicontrol {No Fast-Forward}.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Rebase
            \li Copy local commits to the updated upstream head.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol {Cherry Pick}
            \li Cherry pick the top commit from the selected branch.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Track
            \li Set the current branch to track the selected one.
    \endtable

    \section4 Applying Patches

    Patches are rewriting instructions that can be applied to a set of files.
    To apply a patch file that is open in \QC, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git >
    \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol {Apply from Editor}.

    To select the patch file to apply from the file system, select
    \uicontrol {Apply from File}.

    \section4 Using Stashes

    With Git, you can put your current set of changes onto a virtual shelf
    called a \e stash. Stashes are useful, for example, to put aside a set of
    changes to work on higher priority tasks or to pull in new chages from
    another repository.

    To stash all local changes, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git >
    \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol Stash > \uicontrol Stash. The working copy is reset
    to the state it had after the last commit. To save the current state of your
    unstaged files and reset the repository to its staged state, select
    \uicontrol {Stash Unstaged Files}.

    To display a dialog that shows all known stashes with options to restore,
    display or delete them, select \uicontrol Stashes.

    To save a snapshot of your current work under a name for later reference,
    select \uicontrol {Take Snapshot}. The working copy is unchanged. For example, if
    you want to try something and find out later that it does not work, you can
    discard the changes and return to the state of the snapshot.

    To remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of
    the current working tree state, select \uicontrol {Stash Pop}.

    \section3 Applying Actions to Commits

    To browse a directory or the commit history and to apply actions on the

    \section3 Working with Remote Repositories

    In addition to the standard version control system functions, you can
    select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Remote Repository} > \uicontrol Pull to
    pull changes from the remote repository. If there are locally modified
    files, you are prompted to stash the changes. Select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Git and then select the
    \uicontrol {Pull with rebase} check box to perform a rebase operation while
    pulling.

    \section4 Managing Remote Repositories

    To manage remote repositories available in Git, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git
    > \uicontrol {Remote Repository} > \uicontrol{Manage Remotes}. Double-click the names
    and URLs of the remote repositories to edit them.

    The following operations are supported:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Refresh}
            \li Refresh the list of remote repositories.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Add}
            \li Add a new remote repository.

    To view details of the selected change, select \uicontrol Show.

    To cherry-pick the selected change to the local repository, select
    \uicontrol {Cherry Pick}. To remove the change after testing it, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Local Repository} > \uicontrol Reset. In the
    \uicontrol {Undo Changes to} dialog, select the
    state to reset the working directory to, and then select \uicontrol OK.

    To check out the change in a headless state, select \uicontrol Checkout.

    To refresh the list of changes, select \uicontrol Refresh.

    \section3 Working with Git Tools

    To start a graphical interface to Git, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git >
    \uicontrol {Git Tools} > \uicontrol {Git Gui}.

    \note On OS X, the default Git installation does not contain Git Gui. To
    use Git Gui, install it separately. To start Git Gui from \QC, select
    \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Git, and set the path to
    the environment that contains Git Gui in the \uicontrol {Prepend to PATH} field.

    To start the commit viewer for Git, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git >
    \uicontrol {Git Tools} > \uicontrol Gitk. You can also start the tool to view commits in
    the current document or in the folder that contains the current document.
    To specify arguments for running Gitk, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Git.

    To use some other application for viewing Git history, such as GitX or
    QGit viewer, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol {Version Control} >
    \uicontrol Git and specify the path to the application executable in the
    \uicontrol {Command} field. To start the application, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git
    > \uicontrol {Git Tools} > \uicontrol {Repository Browser}.

    To resolve merge conflicts, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Git > \uicontrol {Git Tools}
    > \uicontrol {Merge Tool}.

    \section2 Using Additional Mercurial Functionality

    Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool.

    The \uicontrol Mercurial submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Import}
            \li Apply changes from a patch file.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Incoming}
            \li Monitor the status of a remote repository by listing
                the changes that will be pulled.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Outgoing}
            \li Monitor the status of a remote repository by listing
                the changes that will be pushed.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Pull}
            \li Pull changes from the remote repository.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Push}
            \li Push changes to the remote repository.
     \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional Perforce Functions

    Perforce is a fast software configuration management system developed by
    Perforce Software.

    When you start \QC, it looks for the executable specified
    in the \uicontrol{P4 command} field in \uicontrol{Tools > Options > Version
    Control > Perforce}. If the file is not found, the following error
    message is displayed in the \uicontrol {Version Control} output pane:
    \uicontrol {Perforce: Unable to determine the repository: "p4.exe"
    terminated with exit code 1}. If you use Perforce, check that the
    path to the executable is specified correctly in the \uicontrol{P4 command}
    field.

    If you do not use Perforce, you can disable the Perforce plugin to
    get rid of the error message. Choose \uicontrol {Help > About Plugins} and
    deselect the \uicontrol Load check box for the \uicontrol Perforce plugin in the
    \uicontrol {Version Control} group.

    In the Perforce options, you can specify workspace details:
    \uicontrol {P4 user}, \uicontrol {P4 client}, and \uicontrol {P4 port}. To
    specify the details individually for several projects, use configuration
    files instead. Create a \c {p4config.txt} configuration file for each
    project in the top level project directory.

    The \uicontrol Perforce submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Describe}
            \li View information about changelists and the files in them.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Edit File}
            \li Open a file for editing.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Opened}
            \li List files that are open for editing.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol{Pending Changes}
            \li Group files for commit.
    \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional Subversion Functions

    Subversion is an open source version control system.

    In addition to the standard version control system functions, you can
    select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Subversion > \uicontrol Describe to display commit log
    messages for a revision.
