    \title Managing Sessions

    When you exit \QC, a snapshot of your current workspace is stored as a
    \e session. To restore the session automatically when you start \QC,
    select \gui {File > Session Manager > Restore last session on startup}.

    A session is an arbitrary collection of:

    \list

        \o  Open projects with their dependencies (including SUBDIRS projects)

        \o  Open editors

        \o  Breakpoints and expressions

        \o  Bookmarks

    \endlist

    A session is  personal, that is, not meant to be shared. It is not supposed
    to reflect the project structure. It contains personal data, such as
    bookmarks and breakpoints that are usually not of interest to other
    developers working on the same projects.

    For example, if you work on a project and need to switch to another project
    for a while, you can save your workspace as a session. This makes it easier
    to return to working on the first project later.

    To create a new session or remove existing sessions, select \gui File >
    \gui{Session Manager}.

    To switch between sessions, choose \gui {File > Session Manager}. If you do
    not create or select a session, \QC always uses the default session, which
    was created the last time you exited \QC.

    When you launch \QC, a list of existing sessions is displayed on the
    \gui{Welcome screen}.

    When you start \QC from the command prompt, you can give the name of
    a session as argument and \QC will start with this session.

    For more information, see \l{Using Command Line Options}.
