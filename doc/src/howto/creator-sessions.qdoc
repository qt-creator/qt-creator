    \title Managing Sessions

    When you exit \QC, a snapshot of your current workspace is stored as a
    \e session. To restore the session automatically when you start \QC,
    select \uicontrol {File > Session Manager > Restore last session on startup}.

    When you open or create any of the following items, they automatically
    become a part of the session:

    \list

        \li Projects with their dependencies (including SUBDIRS projects)

        \li Editors

        \li Breakpoints and expressions

        \li Bookmarks

    \endlist

    A session is  personal, that is, not meant to be shared. It is not supposed
    to reflect the project structure. It contains personal data, such as
    bookmarks and breakpoints that are usually not of interest to other
    developers working on the same projects.

    For example, if you work on a project and need to switch to another project
    for a while, you can clone the current session to save it under a name and
    create a new session for the other project. Everything that you open after
    switching to the new session becomes a part of it. When you want to return
    to working on the first project, switch to the saved session. \QC opens the
    projects and files that belong to the session.

    To save a session under a new name, select \uicontrol File >
    \uicontrol {Session Manager} > \uicontrol Clone.

    To create a new session, select \uicontrol File >
    \uicontrol {Session Manager} > \uicontrol New.

    To switch between sessions, choose \uicontrol {File > Session Manager} >
    \uicontrol {Switch to}.

    When you launch \QC, a list of existing sessions is displayed in the
    \uicontrol Welcome mode.

    When you start \QC from the command line, you can give the name of
    a session as argument and \QC will start with this session.
