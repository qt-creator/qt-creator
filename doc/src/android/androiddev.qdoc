    \title Connecting Android Devices

    You can connect Android devices to the development PC to build, run, debug,
    and analyze applications on them from \QC.

    If you have a tool chain for building applications for Android devices
    installed on the development PC, you can add it to \QC. You can then select
    the \gui {Android} target to run applications on Android devices.

    \section1 Requirements

    To use \QC to develop Qt applications for Android, you need the following:

    \list

        \o  OpenJDK Java Development Kit

            To check whether you have OpenJDK installed, enter the following
            command:

            \c {java -version}

            To install OpenJDK, enter the following command:

            \c {sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk}

        \o  \l{http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi}{Apache Ant} 1.8.0, or
            later

            To check the Ant version, enter the following command on the command
            line:

            \c {ant -version}

        \o  \l{http://necessitas.kde.org/necessitas/necessitas_sdk_installer.php}
            {Necessitas SDK}

    \endlist

    \section1 Configuring Connections

    The Qt for Android SDK automatically sets the paths to the required software
    in \QC.

    To configure connections between \QC and Android devices:

    \list 1

        \o  Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run} >
            \gui {Qt Versions} > \gui Add to add Qt for Android.

        \o  In the \gui {qmake location} field, add the \c qmake path from the
            Qt for Android SDK
            (\c {/opt/necessitas/Android/<qtversion>/bin/qmake} by default).

        \o  Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Android to view and edit
            paths to the required software.

            \image qtcreator-options-android.png "Android options"

        \o  Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run} >
            \gui {Qt Versions} and build the GDB Helper to make the debugging
            output for Qt specific constructs clean and easy to read.

        \o  To build the GDB Helper, select Qt for Android, select \gui Details
            in the \gui Helpers section, and then select \gui Build in the
            \gui {GDB Helper} field.

        \o  Select \gui {Start Android AVD Manager} to create Android virtual
            devices (AVD) that enable you emulate device hardware and software
            on the Android Emulator.

        \o  To specify information for the Android manifest file, select
            \gui Projects > \gui Run, and then select \gui Details to view the
            \gui {Package configurations}. For more information about the
            options you have, see
            \l{Specifying Run Settings for Android Devices}.

        \o  To specify settings for deploying applications to Android, select
            \gui Details to view the \gui {Deploy configurations}. For more
            information about the options you have, see
            \l{Deploying Applications to Android Devices}.

    \endlist

    \section1 Debugging on Android Devices

    Android devices support debugging multi-thread applications in version
    2.2.1 and later. If you use AVD, select Android 2.3, or later. For more
    information, see the Android documentation.

    In addition, debugging is supported at android-10 API level, or higher. In
    the run settings for the project, in the \gui {Android target SDK} field,
    select android-10, or higher. For more information about Android API levels,
    see \l{http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels}
    {What is API Level?}.

    \note Select a \l{glossary-build-config}{debug build configuration} to build
    the application for debugging.
