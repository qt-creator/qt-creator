    \title Designing User Interfaces

    \image creator_designinguserinterface.png

    \QC provides two integrated visual editors, \QMLD and \QD. The integration
    includes project management and code completion.

    \list

        \li \l{Developing Qt Quick Applications}

            You can use wizards to create Qt Quick projects that contain
            boiler-plate code. You can use the code editor (Edit mode) or the
            visual editor (Design mode) to develop Qt Quick applications.
        \li \l{Developing Widget Based Applications}

            Widgets and forms created with \QD are integrated seamlessly with
            programmed code by using the Qt signals and slots mechanism that
            allows you to easily assign behavior to graphical elements. All
            properties set in \QD can be changed dynamically within the code.
            Furthermore, features such as widget promotion and custom plugins
            allow you to use your own widgets with \QD.
        \li \l{Optimizing Applications for Mobile Devices}

            Mobile devices have been designed for use when mobile. Keep the
            characteristics of mobile devices in mind when you create
            applications for them.
