    \section1 Target Platforms

    You can develop applications for the following platforms:

    \list

        \li Desktop

        \li Android

        \li Embedded

        \li Generic remote Linux

    \section2 Embedded Devices

    The Boot to Qt stack can be made to run on a variety of hardware. For
    Qt for Device Creation license holders, tooling is provided to customize the
    contents of the stack as well as to take it into desired production
    hardware.

    For more information about the supported device groups and reference devices,
    see \l{http://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtee-supported-platforms.html}
    {Supported Platforms} in the \l{http://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/index.html}
    {Qt for Device Creation} documentation.

    \section2 Mobile Devices

    The following table summarizes operating system support for developing
    applications for mobile device platforms.
