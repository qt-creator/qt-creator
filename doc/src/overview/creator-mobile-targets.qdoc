    \title Connecting Mobile Devices

    You can connect mobile devices to the development PC to build, run, debug,
    and analyze applications on them from \QC. When you install Qt for a
    target platform, such as Android or QNX, the build and run settings for the
    development targets might be set up automatically in \QC.

    You can connect the device to the development PC using a USB connection.
    Additionally, you can connect Linux-based devices by using a WLAN
    connection.

    \list

        \li \l{Connecting Android Devices}

            Qt applications for Android are compiled as \c {shared objects} that
            are loaded by a Java launcher that is part of Qt.
            This is totally transparent to users. As Qt is composed of libraries
            referencing each other, Qt 4 applications are only supported on
            Android version 1.6, or later, and Qt 5 applications on version
            2.3.3, or later. You must install a Qt version targeting Android and
            the Android SDK and NDK to develop for Android devices.

        \li \l{Connecting Bare Metal Devices}

            You can connect bare metal devices to the development PC and use \QC
            to debug applications on them with GDB or a hardware debugger.

        \li \l{Connecting Embedded Linux Devices}

            If you have a tool chain for building applications for embedded
            Linux devices installed on the development
            PC, you can add it and the device to \QC.

        \li \l{Connecting iOS Devices}

            You use the tools delivered with Xcode to connect devices to \QC.
            \QC detects the tools and configured devices automatically and uses
            the tools to build, deploy, and run applications.

        \li \l{Connecting QNX Devices}

            You can connect QNX devices to the development PC to deploy, run and
            debug applications on them from within \QC. This is currently only
            supported for QNX Neutrino devices, and requires the QNX SDK to be
            installed on the development PC.

        \li \l{Connecting Windows Runtime Devices}

            You can build Windows Store Apps and run them on Windows Phones, the
            Windows Phone Emulator, or the Windows computer in Modern UI mode.
            You can install the necessary tool chains as part of Qt 5.3.
