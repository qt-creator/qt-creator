                If you have not used an integrated development environment (IDE)
                before, or want to know what kind of IDE \QC is, go to
                \l{IDE Overview}.
            \li \b {\l{User Interface}}

                If you have not used \QC before, and want to become familiar
                with the parts of the user interface, go to \l{User Interface}.
            \li \b {\l{Configuring Qt Creator}}

                To make \QC behave more like your favorite code editor or IDE,
                you can change the settings for keyboard shortcuts, color
                schemes, generic highlighting, code snippets, and version
                control systems. For an overview of the options you have, go to
                \l{Configuring Qt Creator}.

            \li
        \row
            \li \b {\l{Building and Running an Example}}

                To check that \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for building and running were
                successfully installed as part of the \QSDK installation, open
                an example application and run it. If you have not done so
                before, go to \l{Building and Running an Example}.
            \li \b {\l{Tutorials}}

                Now you are ready to start developing your own applications.
                Pick a tutorial to follow in \l{Tutorials}. To start developing
                for mobile devices, select \l{Creating a Mobile Application}.
