    \title Connecting iOS Devices

    You can connect iOS devices to a Mac computer with a USB cable to
    build and run applications on them from \QC.

    To be able to use \QC on Mac OS X, you must install Xcode, and therefore,
    you already have the tool chain for building applications for iOS. \QC
    automatically detects the tool chain and creates the necessary
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for building and running applications on
    configured iOS devices.

    You only need Qt libraries that are built for iOS. You can install them as
    part of Qt 5.2, or later.

    \section1 Configuring Devices

    The process of configuring devices and the UI varies slightly depending on
    the Xcode version that you use. The instructions in this section describe
    the process and UI when using Xcode version 4.6.3.

    To configure connections between \QC and an iOS device:

    \list 1

        \li Make sure that you have Xcode and Qt for iOS installed.

        \li Connect the device to the Mac computer with a USB cable.

        \li Start Xcode to configure the device:

            \list 1

                \li Select \gui Windows > \gui Organizer.

                \li Select the \gui + button to add the connected device.

                \li Select the device you want to add in the list of devices.

                \li If you do not have an Apple developer account, you can now
                    create one, for a charge.

                \li When your account is ready, you can add the device. Your
                    Apple developer certificate is copied to the device.

                \li The first time you connect the device, you are asked to
                    enable developer mode on the device.

            \endlist

        The connections between \QC and an iOS device are protected by using an
        iOS Developer Program certificate that you receive from Apple for a
        charge when you
        \l{http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/EnrollingADP/EnrollingADP.html}
         {enroll in the iOS Developer Program}. The certificate is copied to the
        device when you configure the device.

        The next time you connect the device to the Mac computer, \QC
        detects it automatically. To disable automatic connections to a
        device that you do not use for development, select \gui Preferences >
        \gui iOS, and deselect the
        \gui {Ask about devices not in developer mode} check box.

        \note If \QC does not detect the devices, the iOS plugin might not be
        enabled. Select \gui {Qt Creator} > \gui {About Plugins} >
        \gui {Device Support} > \gui iOS and restart \QC.

        \li To specify build settings:

        \list 1

            \li Open a project for an application you want to develop for the
                device.

            \li Select \gui Projects > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui {Add Kit} to
                add a kit for building and running applications on iOS.

                \image qtcreator-ios-add-kit.png "Build & Run Settings"

        \endlist

        \li Select \gui Run to specify run settings.

            Usually, you can use the default settings.

    When you run the project, \QC uses Xcode to deploy the application to the
    device.

    Your signing certificate is used to sign application packages for deployment
    to the device.

    \endlist

    \section1 Viewing Device Connection Status

    When you connect an iOS device to a Mac computer with USB, \QC
    automatically detects the device if you have configured it by using Xcode.
    To view information about the connected device, select \gui Preferences >
    \gui Devices.

    \image qtcreator-ios-device-configurations.png "Devices dialog"

    If the current device state is \gui Connected, (the traffic light icon is
    orange), you need to configure the device using Xcode.

    \section1 Testing on iOS Simulator

    If you do not have an iOS device or you do not want to create an account,
    you can test applications on
    \l{http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html}
    {iOS Simulator}, which is installed as part of Xcode. Each Xcode version
    simulates a predefined set of hardware devices and software versions. You
    can change the simulated hardware and software version from within iOS
    Simulator.

    \QC uses the Xcode version set as current on the Mac computer.
    To check the version, enter the following command:

    \c {xcode-select --print-path}

    To change the version, enter the following command:

    \c {xcode-select --version}
