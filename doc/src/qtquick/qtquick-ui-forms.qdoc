    \title Qt Quick UI Forms

    You can use \QC wizards to create UI forms tha have the filename extension
    \e .ui.qml. The UI forms contain a purely declarative subset of the QML
    language. It is recommended that you edit the forms in the \gui Design mode.
    \QC enforces the use of the supported QML features by displaying error
    messages.

    The following features are not supported:

    \list
        \li JavaScript blocks
        \li Function definitions
        \li Function calls (except \c qsTr)
        \li Other bindings than pure expressions
        \li Signal handlers
        \li States in other items than the root item
        \li Root items that are not derived from \l QQuickItem or \l Item
    \endlist

    The following types are not supported:

    \list
        \li Behavior
        \li Binding
        \li Canvas
        \li Component
        \li Shader Effect
        \li Timer
        \li Transform
        \li Transition
    \endlist

    \section1 Using Qt Quick UI Forms

    You can edit the forms in the \gui Design mode. Items that are supposed to
    be used in QML code have to be exported as properties:

    \code
    Item {
        width: 640
        height: 480

        property alias button: button

        Button {
            anchors.centerIn: parent
            id: button
            text: qsTr("Press Me")
        }
    }
    \endcode

    The property alias exports the button to the QML code that uses the form.
    In \QC Enterprise you can use the
    \inlineimage qmldesigner-export-item-button.png
    (\gui Export) button in the \gui Navigator to export an item as a property:

    \image qmldesigner-export-item.png

    In the QML file that uses the form, you can use the \c button property alias
    to implement signal handlers, for example. In the following code snippet,
    the UI form is called \e MainForm.ui.qml:

    \code
    MainForm {
        anchors.fill: parent
        button.onClicked: messageDialog.show(qsTr("Button pressed"))
    }
    \endcode

    You can also assign properties or define behavior or transitions.
