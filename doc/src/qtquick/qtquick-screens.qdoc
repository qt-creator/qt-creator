    \title Creating Screens

    You can use predefined QML types and your own components to create
    screens. Typically, the main QML file in a Qt Quick project specifies the
    main window of an application.

    The QML files in the project folder are displayed in \uicontrol {QML Components}
    in the \uicontrol Library.

    \section1 Adding Components to Screens

    \list 1

        \li Drag and drop components from the \uicontrol Library to the
            \uicontrol Navigator or \uicontrol {Form Editor}.

        \li Select components in the \uicontrol Navigator to edit their
            properties in the \uicontrol Properties pane.

            For example, you can anchor components to a position on the screen.

    \endlist

    For more information about the ready-made components available, see
    \l {Using Qt Quick Controls}.

    \section1 Using Data Models

    You can create the following types of views to organize items provided by
    \l{Models and Views in Qt Quick}{data models}:

    \list

        \li \l{GridView}{Grid View} provides a grid vizualization of a model.

        \li \l{ListView}{List View} provides a list vizualization of a model.

        \li \l{PathView}{Path View} visualizes the contents of a model along a
            path.

    \endlist

    When you add a \l{GridView}{Grid View}, \l{ListView}{List View}, or
    \l{PathView}{Path View}, the ListModel and the delegate component that
    creates an instance for each item in the model are added automatically.
    You can edit item properties in the \uicontrol Properties pane or
    in the \uicontrol {Text Editor}. You can also replace the default model and
    delegate with other, more complex models and delegates in the
    \uicontrol {Text Editor}.

    \section1 Positioning Items on Screens

    The position of an item on the canvas can be either absolute or relative
    to other items. If you are designing a static user interface,
    \l{Important Concepts In Qt Quick - Positioning#manual-positioning}
    {manual positioning} provides the most efficient form of positioning items
    on the screen. For a dynamic user interface, you can employ the following
    positioning methods provided by Qt Quick:

    \list

        \li \l{Setting Bindings}

        \li \l{Setting Anchors and Margins}

        \li \l{Using Positioners}

        \li \l{Using Layouts}

        \li \l{Organizing Items}

    \endlist

    \section2 Setting Bindings

    \l{Positioning with Bindings}
    {Property binding} is a declarative way of specifying the value of a property.
    Binding allows a property value to be expressed as a JavaScript expression
    that defines the value relative to other property values or data accessible
    in the application. The property value is automatically kept up to date if
    the other properties or data values change.

    Property bindings are created implicitly in QML whenever a property is
    assigned a JavaScript expression. To set JavaScript expressions as values of
    properties in \QMLD, click the circle icon next to a property to open a
    context menu, and select \uicontrol {Set Binding}.

    \image qmldesigner-set-expression.png "Type properties context menu"

    The \uicontrol {Binding Editor} supports code completion. Start typing a
    string and press \key Ctrl+Space to display a list of properties, IDs, and
    code snippets. When you enter a period (.) after a property name, a list of
    available values is displayed. Press \key Enter to accept the first
    suggestion in the list and to complete the code.

    \image qmldesigner-binding-editor.png "Binding Editor"

    To remove bindings, select \uicontrol Reset in the context menu.

    You can set bindings also in the \uicontrol Connections view. For more
    information, see \l {Adding Bindings Between Properties}.

    For more information on the JavaScript environment provided by QML, see
    \l{Integrating QML and JavaScript}.

    Bindings are a black box for \QMLD and using them might have a negative impact on
    performance, so consider setting anchors and margins for items, instead.
    For example, instead of setting \c {parent.width} for an item, you could
    anchor the item to its sibling items on the left and the right.

    \section2 Setting Anchors and Margins

    In an \l{Important Concepts In Qt Quick - Positioning#anchors}
    {anchor-based} layout, each QML type can be thought of as having a set of
    invisible \e anchor lines: top, bottom, left, right, fill, horizontal
    center, vertical center, and baseline.

    In the \uicontrol Layout pane you can set anchors and margins for items. To set
    the anchors of an item, click the anchor buttons. You can combine the
    top/bottom, left/right, and horizontal/vertical anchors to anchor items in
    the corners of the parent item or center them horizontally or vertically
    within the parent item.

    \image qmldesigner-anchor-buttons.png "Anchor buttons"

    For convenience, you can click the \inlineimage anchor_fill.png
    (\uicontrol {Fill to Parent}) toolbar button to apply fill anchors to an
    item and the \inlineimage qtcreator-anchors-reset-icon.png
    (\uicontrol {Reset Anchors}) button to reset the anchors to their saved
    state.

    Specifying the baseline anchor in \QMLD is not supported. You can specify it
    in the \uicontrol {Text Editor}.

    For performance reasons, you can only anchor an item to its siblings and
    direct parent. By default, an item is anchored to its parent when you
    use the anchor buttons. Select a sibling of the item in the \uicontrol Target
    field to anchor to it, instead.

    Arbitrary anchoring is not supported. For example, you cannot specify:
    \c {anchor.left: parent.right}. You have to specify: \c {anchor.left: parent.left}.
    When you use the anchor buttons, anchors to the parent item are always
    specified to the same side. However, anchors to sibling items are specified
    to the opposite side: \c {anchor.left: sibling.right}. This allows you to keep
    sibling items together.

    In the following image, \uicontrol{Rectangle 2} is anchored to \uicontrol{Rectangle 1}
    on its left and to the bottom of its parent.

    \image qmldesigner-anchors.png "Anchoring sibling items"

    The anchors for \uicontrol{Rectangle 2} are specified as follows in code:

    \qml
    Rectangle {
        id: rectangle2
        anchors.left: rectangle1.right
        anchors.leftMargin: 15
        anchors.bottom: parent.bottom
        anchors.bottomMargin: 15
        //
    }
    \endqml

    Margins specify the amount of empty space to leave to the outside of an item.
    Margins only have meaning for anchors. They do not take any effect when using
    other layouts or absolute positioning.

    \section2 Using Positioners

    \l{Important Concepts In Qt Quick - Positioning#positioners}
    {Positioner items} are container items that manage the positions of items in
    a declarative user interface. Positioners behave in a similar way to the
    layout managers used with standard Qt widgets, except that they are also
    containers in their own right.

    You can use the following positioners to arrange items on screens:

    \list

        \li \l[QML] {Column} arranges its child items vertically.

        \li \l[QML] {Row} arranges its child items horizontally.

        \li \l[QML] {Grid}
            arranges its child items so that they are aligned in a grid and
            are not overlapping.

        \li \l[QML] {Flow}
            arranges its child items side by side, wrapping as necessary.

    \endlist

    To lay out several items in a \uicontrol Column, \uicontrol Row,
    \uicontrol Grid, or \uicontrol Flow, select the items on the canvas, and
    then select \uicontrol Layout in the context menu.

    \section2 Using Layouts

    From Qt 5.1, you can use QML types in the \l{qtquicklayouts-index.html}
    {Qt Quick Layouts} module to arrange Qt Quick items on screens. Unlike
    positioners, they manage both the positions and sizes of items in a
    declarative interface. They are well suited for resizable user interfaces.

    You can use the following layout types to arrange items on screens:

    \list

        \li \l{Layout} provides attached properties for items pushed onto a
            \uicontrol {Column Layout}, \uicontrol {Row Layout}, or \uicontrol {Grid Layout}.

        \li \l{ColumnLayout}{Column Layout} provides a grid layout with only one
            column.

        \li \l{RowLayout}{Row Layout} provides a grid layout with only one row.

        \li \l{GridLayout}{Grid Layout} provides a way of dynamically arranging
            items in a grid.

        \li \l{StackLayout}{Stack Layout} provides a stack of items where only
            one item is visible at a time.

    \endlist

    To lay out several items in a \uicontrol {Column Layout}, \uicontrol {Row Layout},
    \uicontrol {Grid Layout}, or \uicontrol {Stack Layout}, select the items in
    the \uicontrol {Form Editor}, and then select \uicontrol Layout in the
    context menu.

    You can also click the \inlineimage column.png
    (\uicontrol {Column Layout}), \inlineimage row.png
    (\uicontrol {Row Layout}), and \inlineimage grid.png
    (\uicontrol {Grid Layout}) toolbar buttons to apply layouts to the selected
    items.

    To make an item within a layout as wide as possible while respecting the
    given constraints, select the item on the canvas and then select
    \uicontrol Layout > \uicontrol {Fill Width} in the context menu. To make the item as
    high as possible, select \uicontrol {Fill Height}.

    \section3 Editing Stack Layouts

    \image qtquick-designer-stacked-view.png

    To add items to a \uicontrol {Stack Layout}, select the
    \inlineimage plus.png
    button next to the type name in the \uicontrol {Form Editor}. To move
    between items, select the \inlineimage prev.png
    (\uicontrol Previous) and \inlineimage next.png
    (\uicontrol Next) buttons.

    To add a tab bar to a stack layout, select \uicontrol {Stacked Container} >
    \uicontrol {Add Tab Bar}.

    To raise or lower the stacking order of an item, select
    \uicontrol {Stacked Container} > \uicontrol {Increase Index} or
    \uicontrol {Decrease Index}.

    \section2 Organizing Items

    From Qt 5.7, you can use the following \l{Qt Quick Controls 2} types to
    organize items on screens:

    \list

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Frame} places a logical group of controls
            within a visual frame.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{GroupBox}{Group Box} is used to lay out a
            logical group of controls together, within a titled visual frame.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Label} is a text label with inherited styling
            and font.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{PageIndicator}{Page Indicator} indicates the
            currently active page.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Pane} provides a background matching with the
            application style and theme.

    \endlist

    \section1 Using States

    Use states and transitions to navigate between screens.

    QML states typically describe user interface configurations, such as the UI
    controls, their properties and behavior and the available actions. For
    example, you can use states to create two screens.

    To add states, click the empty slot in the \uicontrol States pane. Then modify the
    new state in the \uicontrol {Form Editor} or the \uicontrol Properties pane.

    \image qmldesigner-states.png "States pane"

    The properties that you change in a state are highlighted with blue color.
    In the \uicontrol {Text Editor}, you can see the changes recorded as changes
    to the base state.

    To keep the QML code clean, you should create a base state that contains all
    the types you will need in the application. You can then create states,
    in which you hide and show a set of items and modify their properties.
    This allows you to:

    \list

        \li Align items on different screens with each other.

        \li Avoid excessive property changes. If an item is invisible in the
            base state, you must define all changes to its child types as
            property changes, which leads to complicated QML code.

        \li Minimize the differences between the base state and the other states
            to keep the QML code short and readable and to improve performance.

        \li Avoid problems when using transitions and animation when changing
            states.

    \endlist

    To create screens for an application by using states:

    \list 1

        \li In the base state, add all items you will need in the
            application (1).
            While you work on one screen, you can click the
            \inlineimage eye_open.png
            icon to hide items on the canvas that are not part of a screen.

        \li In the \uicontrol States pane, click the empty slot to create a new state
            and give it a name. For example, \c Normal.

        \li In the \uicontrol Properties pane (2), deselect the \uicontrol Visibility check box
            or set \uicontrol Opacity to 0 for each item that is not needed in this
            view. If you specify the setting for the parent item, all child
            items inherit it and are also hidden.

            \image qmldesigner-screen-design.png "Designing screens"

        \li Create additional states for each screen and set the visibility
            or opacity of the items in the screen.

        \li To determine which view opens when the application starts, use the
            \uicontrol {Text Editor} to set the state of the root item of the
           .qml file, as specified by the following code snippet:

            \qml
            Item {
                state: "Normal"
            }
            \endqml

        \endlist

    \section2 Using SCXML State Machines

    To use QML and \QMLD together with an SCXML state machine, add states and
    bind them to the state machine in the \uicontrol Backends tab, as described
    in \l {Managing C++ Backend Objects}.

    In the \uicontrol States pane, you can edit the \c when condition of states
    to map QML states to the states of the SCXML state machine. For an example,
    see \l {Qt SCXML Traffic Light QML Example (Dynamic)}.

    \image qmldesigner-states-when-condition.png

    \section1 Animating Screens

    To make movement between states smooth, you can specify transitions. You can
    use different types of animated transitions. For example, you can animate
    changes to property values and colors. You can use rotation animation to
    control the direction of rotation. For more information, see
    \l{Animation and Transitions in Qt Quick}.

    You can use the \c ParallelAnimation type to start several animations at
    the same time. Or use the \c SequentialAnimation type to run them one
    after another.

    You can use the \uicontrol {Text Editor} to specify transitions. For more
    information, see \l{Transition}.

    \section1 Adding User Interaction Methods

    You can use the following QML types to add basic interaction methods to
    screens:

    \list

        \li \l{Flickable}
            items can be flicked horizontally or vertically.

        \li \l{FocusScope}{Focus Scope}
            assists in keyboard focus handling when building reusable QML
            components.

        \li \l [QML]{MouseArea}{Mouse Area} enables simple mouse handling.

    \endlist

    Since Qt 5.7, you can also use the following \l{Qt Quick Controls 2} types
    to inform users about the progress of the application or to gather input
    from the user:

    \list

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{BusyIndicator}{Busy Indicator} indicates
            activity while content is being loaded.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Button} provides a push button that you can
            associate with an action.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{CheckBox}{Check Box} provides an option button
            that can be toggled on (checked) or off (unchecked).

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{CheckDelegate}{Check Delegate} presents an
            item delegate that can be toggled on (checked) or off (unchecked).

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{ComboBox}{Combo Box} is a combined button and
            popup list that is populated by using a data model.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Dial} is a circular dial that is rotated to
            set a value.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{ItemDelegate}{Item Delegate} is a standard
            view item that can be used in various views and controls.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{ProgressBar}{Progress Bar} indicates the
            progress of an operation.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{RadioButton}{Radio Button} provides an option
            button that can be switched on (checked) or off (unchecked).

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{RadioDelegate}{Radio Delegate} presents an
            item delegate that can be toggled on (checked) or off (unchecked).

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Slider} selects a value by sliding a handle
            along a track.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{SpinBox}{Spin Box} enables the user to specify
            a value by clicking the up or down buttons, by pressing up or down
            on the keyboard, or by entering a value in the box.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Switch} is an option button that can be
            toggled on or off.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{TextArea}{Text Area} displays multiple lines
            of editable formatted text.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{TextField}{Text Field} displays a single line
            of editable plain text.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{ToolBar}{Tool Bar} is a container of
            application-wide and context sensitive actions and controls, such as
            navigation buttons and search fields.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{ToolButton}{Tool Button} is a button
            that is functionally similar to \uicontrol Button, but provides a
            look that is more suitable for a \uicontrol {Tool Bar}.

        \li \l [QtQuickControls2]{Tumbler} is a spinnable wheel of items that
            can be selected.

    \endlist


    \section1 Implementing Application Logic

    A user interface is only a part of an application, and not really useful by itself.
    You can use Qt or JavaScript to implement the application logic. For more information on
    using JavaScript, see \l{Integrating QML and JavaScript}.

    For an example of how to use JavaScript to develop a game, see the
    \l{QML Advanced Tutorial}.
