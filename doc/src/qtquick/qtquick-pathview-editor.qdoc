    \title Editing PathView Properties

    \commercial

    A \l{PathView} lays out data provided by data models on a \l{Path}.

    A graphical spline editor enables you to specify PathView paths, which
    is a non-trivial task to do in the code editor (commercial only).

    \image qmldesigner-pathview-editor.png "PathView editor"

    To start editing the Path, double-click the PathView on the canvas. The
    editor composes the path of PathCubic path objects. They are cubic Bezier
    curves to a given position with two control points. Drag and drop the
    control points to construct the curve.

    In addition, PathLine and PathQuad path objects are supported indirectly.
    To make a curve segment linear, select \uicontrol {Make Curve Segment Straight} in
    the context menu.

    By default, the Path is closed, which means that its start and end points
    are identical. To create separate start and end points for it, right-click
    an edit point to open a context menu, and deselect \uicontrol {Closed Path}.

    To add intermediary points to a curve segment, select \uicontrol {Split Segment}
    in the context menu.

    In the \uicontrol Properties pane, you can specify other properties for
    the PathView. For example, what is the maximum distance from the path that
    initiates mouse dragging and what is the rate at which a flick will
    decelerate.
