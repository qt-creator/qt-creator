    \title Browsing ISO 7000 Icons

    \commercial

    You can add icons from an ISO 7000 icon library that is installed with \QC
    to Qt Quick applications (commercial only). You can use the
    \uicontrol {ISO Icon Browser} to add a \l {Picture} type and select the
    icon to use for the type. You can change the default color of the icon.

    \section1 Using ISO Icons in Applications

    \list 1

        \li Create a new Qt Quick Application or open an application in \QC.

        \li Open the Qt Quick UI form in the \uicontrol Design mode.

        \li In the \uicontrol Library, select \uicontrol Imports >
            \uicontrol {Add Import} > \uicontrol {QtQuick.Extras} to import the
            \l {Qt Quick Extras} module.

        \li Drag and drop a \uicontrol Picture element from the library to the
            canvas.

        \li Right-click the picture element and select \uicontrol {Choose Icon}
            to open the \uicontrol {ISO Icon Browser}.

        \li To find icons, select a criterion for filtering icons and enter a
            search string.

        \li Select an icon in the list, and then select \uicontrol OK to add
            the icon.

        \li To view the icon you added, press \key {Ctrl+R} (or \key {Cmd+R})
            to run the application.

        \li To adjust the icon color, select the icon on the canvas, and then
            select \uicontrol {Edit Color} in the context menu.

    \endlist

    \QC generates a Qt resource file called \c iso-icons.qrc that adds the
    icons as a part of your project for delivery with your application.
