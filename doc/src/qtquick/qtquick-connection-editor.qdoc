    \title Adding Connections

    You can use the \uicontrol {Connections} view to:

    \list

        \li Connect objects to signals.

        \li Specify dynamic properties for objects.

        \li Create bindings between the properties of two objects.

    \endlist

    \section1 Connecting Objects to Signals

    To connect objects to signals in QML, create \l{Connections} objects.

    To create the connections:

    \list 1

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Connections} tab.

        \li Select \uicontrol Target to add the object to connect to a signal.

        \li Select \uicontrol {Signal Handler} to select the signal that the connection
            will listen to from a list of all signals available for the object.

        \li Select \uicontrol Actions to specify the action to perform when
            the signal is emitted. You use JavaScript to specify the actions.

    \endlist

    \section1 Specifying Dynamic Properties

    You can bind \l{Properties} to dynamic expressions to define global properties for an
    object that can be read by other objects. For example, you can specify
    global properties for the root object that you can use in the child objects.

    To specify dynamic properties for an object:

    \list 1

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Dynamic Properties} tab.

        \li Select \uicontrol Item to select the object to specify the property for.

        \li Select \uicontrol Property to give a name to the property.

        \li Select \uicontrol {Property Type} to specify the type of the property.

        \li Select \uicontrol {Property Value} to specify the value of the property.

    \endlist

    \section1 Adding Bindings Between Properties

    To dynamically change the behavior of an object, you can create a
    \l{Property Binding} between the properties of two objects.

    \image qmldesigner-bindings.png

    To bind a property of an object to the property of another object:

    \list 1

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Bindings} tab.

        \li Select \uicontrol Item to select the target object whose property you want
            to change dynamically.

        \li Select \uicontrol Property to specify the property to bind to a source
            property.

        \li Select \uicontrol {Source Item} to specify the object whose property you
            want to use to determine the behavior of the target object.

        \li Select \uicontrol {Source Property} to specify the property to bind the
            target property to.

    \endlist
