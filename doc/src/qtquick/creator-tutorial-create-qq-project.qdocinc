    \QC generates two UI files, \e Page1Form.ui.qml and \e Page2Form.ui.qml,
    and a QML file, \e main.qml. You can modify \e Page1Form.ui.qml in the
    \uicontrol {Form Editor} to create the application main view and \e main.qml
    in the \uicontrol {Text Editor} to add the application logic. For the
    purposes of this example, you can ignore \e Page2Form.ui.qml.
