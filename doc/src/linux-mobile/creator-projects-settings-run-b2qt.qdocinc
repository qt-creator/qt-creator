    \section1 Specifying Run Settings for Embedded Devices

    To run and debug an application on an embedded device (commercial only), you
    must create connections from the development host to the device and add the
    device configurations to \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits}. Select
    \uicontrol {Manage Kits} to add devices to kits. For more information, see
    the \l{http://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtee-installation-guide.html}
    {Installation Guide} in the
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/index.html}{Qt for Device Creation}
    documentation.

    The run settings display the path to the executable file on the development
    host and on the device.

    For more information on the deployment steps, see
    \l{Deploying Applications to Embedded Linux Devices}.
