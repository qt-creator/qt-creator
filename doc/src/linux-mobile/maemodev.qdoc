    \title Connecting Maemo Devices

    Maemo 5 (Fremantle) is a Linux-based software platform developed by Nokia
    for mobile devices. It allows developers to create
    applications using the Qt framework.
    You can install the whole tool chain that you need to create, build, debug,
    run, and deploy Maemo 5 applications as a part of the custom installation
    in the Qt 4 SDK online installer.

    \if defined(qcmanual)
    For more
    information about the Maemo 5 platform, see
    \l{http://maemo.org/intro/platform/}{Software Platform} on the Maemo web site.
    \endif

    For more information about developing applications for the Maemo 5
    platform, select \gui {Help > Index} and look for \gui {Platform Notes},
    or see
    \l{http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt-maemo/platform-notes-maemo5.html}{Platform Notes - Maemo 5}.

    \section1 Hardware and Software Requirements for Maemo Devices

    To build and run Qt applications for Maemo 5, you need the following:
    \list

        \o  Maemo 5 device: Nokia N900 with software update release 1.3
                    (V20.2010.36-2) or later installed.
       \if defined(qcmanual)
       \o  MADDE cross-platform Maemo development
           tool (installed as part of the Qt 4 SDK).
       \endif

       \o Nokia USB drivers.

       Only needed if you develop on Windows and if you use a USB connection
       to run applications on the device. The drivers are
       installed as part of the Qt 4 SDK. You can also download them from
       \l{https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=801&release_id=2655}{PC Connectivity}
       on the Maemo web site. Download and install the latest
       PC_Connectivity_<version>.exe (at the time of writing,
       PC_Connectivity_0.9.4.exe).

    \endlist

    \note The only supported build system for Maemo 5 in \QC is qmake.

    \section1 Setting Up Connectivity in Maemo Devices

    You can connect your device to your development PC using either a USB or
    WLAN connection.

    For the device, you need to use a connectivity tool (Mad Developer) to
    create the
    device-side end point for USB and WLAN connections. It provides no
    diagnostics functions but is essential for creating connections between the
    device and your development PC.

    To use a WLAN connection, you must activate WLAN on the device and connect
    it to the same WLAN as the development PC. The network address is displayed
    in the connectivity tool.

    To use a USB connection, you need to set up the device as a network device
    on the development PC.

    \note If you plan to connect your development PC to the device only over
    WLAN, you can
    ignore the USB-specific parts in the following sections.

    \section2 Installing and Configuring Mad Developer

    Install Mad Developer on a Nokia N900 device and configure
    a connection between the development PC and a device.

    \note The following instructions describe Mad Developer 2.1. The process and
    text labels might differ on other Mad Developer versions.

    To install and configure Mad Developer:

     \list 1
         \o On the Nokia N900, select \gui{App Manager > Download} > \gui{Development} > \gui{mad-developer}
         to install the Mad Developer software package.
         \o Click \gui {Mad Developer} to start the Mad Developer application.

         \o To use a WLAN connection, activate WLAN on the device and connect
         to the same network as the development PC. You can see the network
         address in the \gui wlan0 field.

         \o To use a USB connection:

         \list a

         \o If you are using Microsoft Windows as development host, you must
         change the driver loaded for instantiating the connection.
         In the Mad Developer, select \gui{Manage USB} and select \gui{Load g_ether}.

         \o To set up the USB settings, click \gui Edit on the \gui usb0 row and
         confirm by clicking \gui Configure.

          \note By default, you do not need to make changes. The \gui usb0 row
          displays the IP address 192.168.2.15.

          \endlist

       \o Select \gui{Developer Password} to generate a password for a freshly
          created user called \bold developer. The password stays valid for as long
          as the password generation dialog is open. You enter the password when
          you configure the connection in \QC.

          \image qtcreator-mad-developer-screenshot.png
    \endlist

    \section1 Installing Qt Mobility Libraries

    To develop applications for the Nokia N900 devices that use the Qt Mobility
    APIs, you must install the
    Qt Mobility Libraries on the devices. The libraries are not available in the
    device package
    manager, and therefore, you must install them from the command line as the
    root user:

    \list 1

        \o On the device, in \gui Programs, select \c {X Terminal} to open a
        terminal window.

        \o To install Qt Mobility libraries, enter the following command:
        \c{/usr/lib/mad-developer/devrootsh apt-get install libqtm-*}

        \o To confirm the installation, enter: \c Y

        \o Close the terminal.

    \endlist

    \section1 Setting Up USB Connections to Maemo Devices

    Use the network configuration tools on your platform to specify the USB
    connection to the device on the development PC. You do not need to do this
    if you use a WLAN connection.

    \section2 Linux

    The device uses the IP address 192.168.2.15 with the subnet 255.255.255.0
    for its USB connection by default, so you can create the network interface
    with a different address inside the same subnet too.

    \note If you have changed the IP address of the device in the connectivity
    tool, you need to reflect those changes in your development PC USB
    network settings.

    Run the following command in a shell as root user:
                  \c{ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.14 up}

    \section2 Windows

    When you connect the device to your Windows PC, Windows tries to install a
    driver for the Linux USB Ethernet connection. In the
    \gui{Found New Hardware Wizard}, select \gui{No, not this time} in the
    first dialog and \gui{Install the software automatically} in the second
    dialog.

    To specify a network connection:

    \list 1

    \o Open the Network Connections window.

    \o Select the Linux USB Ethernet
    connection that is displayed as a new Local Area Connection.

    \o Edit the \gui {Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)} properties
    to specify the IP address for the connection.
    In the \gui {Use the following IP address} field, enter the following values:
    \list
       \o  \gui {IP Address}: \bold {192.168.2.14}
       \o  \gui SubnetMask: \bold {255.255.255.0}
       \o  \gui {Default gateway}: leave this field empty
    \endlist

    \endlist

    Depending on
    your version of Microsoft Windows you may have to unplug and re-plug the
    device to reload the driver with its configuration accordingly.

    \section1 Configuring Connections to Maemo Devices

    To be able to run and debug applications on the Maemo
    emulator and devices, you must set up connections to the emulator and
    devices in the \QC build and run settings. If you install Qt 4 SDK, the
    connection to the emulator is configured automatically and you
    only need to configure a connection to the device.

    You use a wizard to create the connections. You can edit the settings later
    in \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Devices.

    \image qtcreator-maemo-device-configurations.png "Devices dialog"

    By default, you create the connection as the \e developer user. This
    protects real user data on the device from getting corrupted during
    testing. If you write applications that use Qt Mobility APIs, you might want
    to test them with real user data. To create a connection as a user, specify
    the \gui Username and \gui Password in \QC. For more information, see
    \if defined(qcmanual)
    \l{Testing with User Data on Maemo Devices}.
    \else
    \l{http://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator/creator-developing-maemo.html#testing-with-user-data-on-maemo-devices}
    {Testing with User Data on Maemo Devices}.
    \endif


    You can protect the connections between \QC and
    a device by using either a password or an SSH key. If you use a password, you
    must generate it in the connectivity tool and enter it in \QC every time
    you start the connectivity tool.

    If you do not have an SSH key, you can create it in \QC.
    Encrypted keys are not supported. For more
    information, see
    \if defined(qcmanual)
    \l{Generating SSH Keys}.
    \else
    \l{http://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator/creator-developing-meego.html#generating-ssh-keys}
    {Generating SSH Keys}.
    \endif


    You can view processes running on devices and kill them. For more
    information, see
    \if defined(qcmanual)
    \l{Managing Device Processes}.
    \else
    \l{http://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator/creator-developing-meego.html#managing-device-processes}
    {Managing Device Processes}.
    \endif

            specify parameters for accessing devices:

            \list a

            \o Connect your device to the development PC via a USB cable or
            a WLAN. For a USB connection, you are prompted to select the mode
            to use. Choose \gui{PC suite mode}.

            \note If you experience connection problems due to a USB port issue,
            switch to a different port or use WLAN to connect to the device.

            \o  Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Devices > \gui Add.

            \o  Select \gui {Maemo5/Fremantle} > \gui {Start Wizard}.

            \image qtcreator-dev-conf-maemo.png "Maemo device"

            \o In the \gui {The name to identify this configuration} field,
            enter a name for the connection.

            use for SSH connections.

            \o Click \gui Next.

            \o Follow the instructions of the wizard to create the connection.

            \endlist

        \if defined(qcmanual)

        \o To test applications on the emulator (QEMU) separately, you must
           create a connection to it from the development PC. If you installed
           Qt 4 SDK, the connection is created automatically and you can omit this
           step.

            \list a

                \o  In \QC, select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Devices >

                    \c{QtSDK\Maemo\4.6.2\targets\fremantle-pr13\bin\}.

                \o  In the \gui Debugger field, specify the path to GDB. By
                    default, the Qt 4 SDK installer places the debugger
                    in the following folder:
                    \c{QtSDK\Maemo\4.6.2\targets\fremantle-pr13\bin\}.

                \o  In the \gui {Qt version} field, choose the MADDE Qt version
                    for Maemo5/Fremantle. By default, the Qt 4 SDK installer
                    places qmake in the following folder:
                    \c{QtSDK\Maemo\4.6.2\targets\fremantle-pr13\bin\}.

            \endlist

                You can leave the \gui {Qt mkspec} field empty.
