    \title Beautifying Source Code

    You can use the experimental Beautifier plugin to format your source code
    by using the following external tools:

    \list

        \li \l{http://astyle.sourceforge.net}{Artistic Style}

        \li \l{http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html}{ClangFormat}

        \li \l{http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net}{Uncrustify}

    \endlist

    The Beautifier plugin parses the source code into component structures, such
    as assignment statements, if blocks, loops, and so on, and formats them as
    specified in the Beautifier options. You can use a predefined style or
    define your own style.

    To use the Beautifier plugin:

    \list 1

        \li Download and install the tool to use for formatting source code:

            \list
                \li \l{http://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/astyle}
                    {Artistic Style}
                \li \l{http://llvm.org/releases/download.html}{ClangFormat}
                \li \l{http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncrustify/files/uncrustify}
                    {Uncrustify}
            \endlist

            You might have to build the tools from sources for some platforms.

        \li Select \uicontrol Help > \uicontrol {About Plugins} > \uicontrol {C++} >
            \uicontrol Beautifier to enable the plugin.

        \li Restart \QC to be able to use the plugin.

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Beautifier
            to specify settings for the tool you want to use.

            \image beautifier_options.png

        \li In the \uicontrol {Artistic Style command},
            \uicontrol {Clang Format command}, or
            \uicontrol {Uncrustify command} field, specify the path to the tool
            executable.

        \li In the \uicontrol Options group, select the configuration file that
            defines the style to use in the source files. If you select several
            options, they are applied from top down.

            \list

                \li Select the \uicontrol {Use file defined in project files}
                    option to use the configuration file defined in the qmake
                    DISTFILES variable as the configuration file for the
                    selected tool.

                \li Select the \uicontrol {Use file in $HOME} option to use the
                    specified file in the user's home directory as the
                    configuration file for the selected tool.

                \li Select the \uicontrol {Use customized style} option, and
                    then \uicontrol Add to define your own style.

                    Define code formatting in the
                    \uicontrol {Edit Configuration} dialog. It provides syntax
                    highlighting, auto-completion, and context-sensitive help.
                    For these features, you must have the tool installed.

                   \image beautifier_editor.png

            \endlist

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Beautifier >
            \uicontrol {Artistic Style}, \uicontrol ClangFormat, or
            \uicontrol Uncrustify > \uicontrol {Format Current File} to format
            the currently open file.

            You can \l{Keyboard Shortcuts}{create keyboard shortcuts} for the
            functions.

    \endlist

    In addition to the \uicontrol {Format Current File} command, ClangFormat
    and Uncrustify provide the \uicontrol {Format Selected Text} command. If you
    select it when no text is selected, nothing happens. To format the entire
    file in this case when using Clang, select the
    \uicontrol {Format entire file if no text was selected} check box in the
    \uicontrol {Clang Format} options.
