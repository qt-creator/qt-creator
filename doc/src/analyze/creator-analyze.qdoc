    \title Analyzing Code

    You can use the code analysis tools in the \uicontrol Debug mode. To
    switch to \uicontrol Debug mode, select \uicontrol Debug in the mode
    selector, or select the \uicontrol {Analyze} menu and then select a tool.
    When you are in the \uicontrol Debug mode, you can switch between tools by
    selecting them in the menu on the toolbar.

    You can drag and drop the views in the \uicontrol Debug mode to new
    positions on the screen. The size and position of views are saved for future
    sessions. Select \uicontrol {Window > Views > Reset to Default Layout} to
    reset the views to their original sizes and positions.

    You can use the following code analysis tools in the \uicontrol Debug
    mode:

    \list

        \li \l{Profiling QML Applications}{QML Profiler}

            You can inspect binding evaluations, signal handling, and
            painting operations when running QML code. This is useful for
            identifying potential bottlenecks, especially in the evaluation
            of bindings.

        \li \l{Using Valgrind Code Analysis Tools}{Valgrind Code Analysis Tools}

            You can detect problems in memory management by using the Memcheck
            tool and find cache misses in the code by using the Callgrind tool.

        \li \l{Using Clang Tools}{Clang Tools}

            You can detect problems in C, C++, and Objective-C programs by
            using Clang-Tidy and Clazy.

        \li \l{Detecting Memory Leaks with Heob}

            You can use the Heob heap observer on Windows to detect buffer
            overruns and memory leaks.

        \li \l{Analyzing CPU Usage}{CPU Usage Analyzer}

            You can analyze the CPU usage of embedded applications and Linux
            desktop applications with the CPU Usage Analyzer (commercial only)
            that integrates the Linux Perf tool.
