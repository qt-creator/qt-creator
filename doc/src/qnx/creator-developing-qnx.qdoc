    \title Connecting QNX Devices

    You can connect QNX devices to the development PC to deploy, run and debug
    applications on them from within \QC.

    \section1 Adding a QNX Neutrino Device in \QC

    Adding a QNX Neutrino device is very similar to \l{Connecting Embedded
    Linux Devices}, except you need to select \uicontrol {QNX Device} in the
    \uicontrol {Device Configuration} wizard.

    \section1 Adding Kits for QNX Devices

    To view QNX device settings, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol QNX. Select the \uicontrol {Generate kits}
    check box to allow \QC to generate kits for QNX development. For more
    information about how to create the kits manually, see \l {Adding Kits}.
