    \title Connecting QNX Devices

    You can connect QNX devices to the development PC to deploy, run and debug
    applications on them from within \QC.

    \section1 Adding a QNX Neutrino Device in \QC

    Adding a QNX Neutrino device is very similar to \l{Connecting Embedded
    Linux Devices}, except you need to select \uicontrol {QNX Device} in the
    \uicontrol {Device Configuration} wizard.
