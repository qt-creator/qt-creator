    \title Deploying Applications to QNX Neutrino Devices

    You can deploy applications to QNX Neutrino devices in the way that is
    described in \l{Deploying Applications to Embedded Linux Devices}.

    \image qtcreator-qnx-deployment.png "Deploy to device"

    The files to be installed are listed in the \uicontrol {Deployment} step,
    the \uicontrol {Files to install for subproject} field. The
    \uicontrol {Local File Path} field displays the location of the file on the
    development PC. The \uicontrol {Remote Directory} field displays the folder
    where the file is installed on the device. Text in red color indicates that
    the information is missing. Edit the qmake \l{Variables#installs}
    {INSTALLS variable} in the project \c .pro file to add the missing files.

    When you run the application, \QC copies the necessary files to the device
    and starts the application on it.
