    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for QNX Devices

    To run and debug an application on a QNX device, you must
    create connections from the development PC to the device. Click
    \uicontrol {Manage device configurations} to create a connection. For more
    information, see \l{Connecting QNX Devices}.

    Specifying run settings for QNX Neutrino devices is very similar to
    \l{Specifying Run Settings for Linux-Based Devices}.
