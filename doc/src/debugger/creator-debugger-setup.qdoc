    \title Setting Up Debugger

    The main debugger settings are associated with the
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} you build and run your project with. To
    specify the debugger and compiler to use for each kit, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits.

    You need to set up the debugger only if the automatic setup fails, because
    the native debugger is missing (as is usually the case for the CDB debugger
    on Windows, which you always must install yourself) or because the installed
    version is not supported (for example, when your system contains no, or an
    outdated version of GDB and you want to use a locally installed replacement
    instead).

    \note If you need to change the debugger to use for an automatically
    detected \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit}, you can \uicontrol Clone the
    kit and change the parameters in the clone. Make sure to select the cloned
    kit for your project.

    If the debugger you want to use is not automatically detected, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits >
    \uicontrol Debuggers > \uicontrol Add to add it.

    \note To use the debugging tools for Windows, you must install them and add
    the Symbol Server provided by Microsoft to the symbol search path of the
    debugger. For more information, see \l{Setting CDB Paths on Windows}.

    \note To use the Free Software Foundation (FSF) version of GDB on \macos, you
    must sign it and modify your \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} settings.

    This section explains the options you have for debugging C++ code and
    provides installation notes for the supported native debuggers. It also
    applies for code in other compiled languages such as C, FORTRAN, Ada.

    For more information on the debugger modes, see
    \l{Launching the Debugger in Different Modes}.

    \section1 Supported Native Debugger Versions

    Qt Creator supports native debuggers when working with compiled code. On
    most supported platforms, the GNU Symbolic Debugger GDB can be used. On
    Microsoft Windows, when using the Microsoft tool chain the Microsoft Console
    Debugger CDB, is needed. On \macos, the LLDB debugger can be used. Basic
    support for LLDB is also available on Linux, but it is restricted by LLDB's
    capabilities there, and considered experimental.

    The following table summarizes the support for debugging C++ code:

    \table
        \header
            \li Platform
            \li Compiler
            \li Native Debugger
        \row
            \li Linux
            \li GCC, ICC
            \li GDB, LLDB (experimental)
        \row
            \li Unix
            \li GCC, ICC
            \li GDB
        \row
            \li \macos
            \li GCC, Clang
            \li LLDB, FSF GDB (experimental)
        \row
            \li Windows/MinGW
            \li GCC
            \li GDB
        \row
            \li Windows/MSVC
            \li Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
            \li Debugging Tools for Windows/CDB
    \endtable

    \section2 Supported GDB Versions

    Starting with version 3.1, \QC requires the Python scripting extension. GDB
    builds without Python scripting are not supported anymore and will not work.
    The minimum supported version is GDB 7.5 using Python version 2.7, or 3.3,
    or newer.

    For remote debugging using GDB and GDB server, the minimum supported version
    of GDB server on the target \l{glossary-device}{device} is 7.0.

    \section2 Supported CDB Versions

    All versions of CDB targeting platforms supported by Qt are supported by
    \QC.

    \section2 Supported LLDB Versions

    The LLDB native debugger has similar functionality to the GDB debugger. LLDB
    is the default debugger in Xcode on \macos for supporting C++ on the desktop.
    LLDB is typically used with the Clang compiler (even though you can use it
    with GCC, too).

    On \macos you can use the LLDB version delivered with Xcode or build from source.
    The minimum supported version is LLDB 320.4.

    On Linux, the minimum supported version is LLDB 3.8.

    \section2 GDB Adapter Modes

    [Advanced Topic]

    The GDB native debugger used internally by the debugger plugin runs in
    different adapter modes to cope with the variety of supported platforms and
    environments. All GDB adapters inherit from  AbstractGdbAdapter:

    \list

        \li PlainGdbAdapter debugs locally started GUI processes. It is
            physically split into parts that are relevant only when Python is
            available, parts relevant only when Python is not available, and
            mixed code.

        \li TermGdbAdapter debugs locally started processes that need a console.

        \li AttachGdbAdapter debugs local processes started outside \QC.

        \li CoreGdbAdapter debugs core files generated from crashes.

        \li RemoteGdbAdapter interacts with the GDB server running on Linux.

    \endlist

    \endomit

    \section1 Installing Native Debuggers

    The following sections provide information about installing native
    debuggers.

    \section2 GDB

    On Windows, use the Python-enabled GDB versions that is bundled
    with the Qt package or comes with recent versions of MinGW. On
    most Linux distributions, the GDB builds shipped with the system
    are sufficient.

    You can also build your own GDB, as instructed in
    \l{http://wiki.qt.io/QtCreator_Build_Gdb}{Building GDB}.

    Builds of GDB shipped with Xcode on \macos are no longer supported.

    \section2 Debugging Tools for Windows

    To use the CDB debugger, you must install the
    \e{Debugging tools for Windows}. You can download them from
    \l{https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk}
    {Download and Install Debugging Tools for Windows} as part of the Windows
    SDK.

    \note Visual Studio does not include the Debugging tools needed,
    and therefore, you must install them separately.

    In addition, you must select \uicontrol {Qt Creator CDB Debugger Support}
    (in \uicontrol Qt > \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol {\QC}) when you install
    Qt or the stand-alone \QC.

    When manually building \QC using
    the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler, the build process checks for
    the required files in
    \c{"%ProgramFiles%\Debugging Tools for Windows"}.

    It is highly recommended that you add the Symbol Server provided
    by Microsoft to the symbol search path of the debugger. The
    Symbol Server provides you with debugging informaton for the
    operating system libraries for debugging Windows applications.
    For more information, see
    \l{Setting CDB Paths on Windows}.

    \section2 Debugging Tools for \macos

    The Qt binary distribution contains both debug and release
    variants of the libraries. But you have to explicitly tell the
    runtime linker that you want to use the debug libraries even if
    your application is compiled as debug, as release is the default
    library.

    If you use a qmake based project in \QC,  you can set a flag in
    your \l{glossary-run-config}{run configuration}, in
    \uicontrol Projects mode. In the run configuration, select
    \uicontrol{Use debug version of frameworks}.

    For more detailed information about debugging on \macos,
    see: \l{http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#technotes/tn2124/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003391}
    {Mac OS X Debugging Magic}.

    \section2 LLDB

    We recommend using the LLDB version that is delivered with the latest Xcode.

    \section1 Mapping Source Paths

    To enable the debugger to step into the code and display the source code
    when using a copy of the source tree at a location different from the one
    at which the libraries were built, map the source paths to target paths:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Debugger >
            \uicontrol General > \uicontrol Add.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Source path} field, specify the source path in
            the debug information of the executable as reported by the debugger.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Target path} field, specify the actual location
            of the source tree on the local machine.

    \endlist

    \section1 Setting CDB Paths on Windows

    To obtain debugging information for the operating system libraries for
    debugging Windows applications, add the Symbol Server provided by Microsoft
    to the symbol search path of the debugger:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Debugger >
            \uicontrol {CDB Paths}.

            \image qtcreator-debugger-cdb-paths.png

        \li In the \uicontrol {Symbol Paths} group, select \uicontrol Insert.

        \li Select the directory where you want to store the cached information.

            Use a subfolder in a temporary directory, such as
            \c {C:\temp\symbolcache}.

        \li Select \uicontrol OK.

    \endlist

    \note Populating the cache might take a long time on a slow network
    connection.

    To use the Source Server infrastructure for fetching missing source files
    directly from version control or the web, enter the following string in
    the \uicontrol {Source Paths} field: \c srv*.

    \section1 Setting up FSF GDB for \macos

    To use FSF GDB on \macos, you must sign it and add it to the \QC
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits}.

    \list 1

        \li To create a key for signing FSF GDB, select
            \uicontrol {Keychain Access} > \uicontrol {Certificate Assistant} >
            \uicontrol {Create a Certificate}:

        \list 1

            \li In the \uicontrol Name field, input \uicontrol fsfgdb to
                replace the existing content.

            \li In the \uicontrol {Certificate Type} field, select
                \uicontrol {Code Signing}.

            \li Select the \uicontrol {Let me override defaults} check box.

            \li Select \uicontrol Continue, and follow the instructions of the
                wizard (use the default settings), until the
                \uicontrol {Specify a Location For The Certificate} dialog
                opens.

            \li In the \uicontrol Keychain field, select \uicontrol System.

            \li Select \uicontrol {Keychain Access} > \uicontrol System, and
                locate the certificate.

            \li Double click the certificate to view certificate information.

            \li In the \uicontrol Trust section, select
                \uicontrol {Always Trust} in the
                \uicontrol {When using this certificate} field, and then close
                the dialog.

        \endlist

        \li To sign the binary, enter the following command in the terminal:

            \code
            codesign -f -s "fsfgdb" $INSTALL_LOCATION/fsfgdb
            \endcode

        \li In \QC, select \uicontrol {Qt Creator} > \uicontrol Preferences >
            \uicontrol Kits > \uicontrol Add to
            create a kit that uses FSF GDB.

            \li In the \uicontrol Debugger field, specify the path to FSF GDB
                (\c $HOME/gdb72/bin/fsfgdb, but with an explicit value for
                \c $HOME).

        \li To use the debugger, add the kit in the \uicontrol {Build Settings}
            of the project.

    \endlist

    \section1 Setting Up Experimental LLDB Support

    To use the experimental interface to LLDB, you must set up a kit that uses
    the LLDB engine and select the kit for your project:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
            \uicontrol Kits.

        \li Select an automatically created kit in the list, and then select
            \uicontrol Clone to create a copy of the kit.

        \li In the \uicontrol Debugger field, select an LLDB Engine. If an LLDB
            Engine is not listed, select \uicontrol Manage to add it in
            \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Kits >
            \uicontrol Debuggers. For more information, see
            \l {Adding Debuggers}.

        \li To use the debugger, add the kit in the \uicontrol {Build Settings}
            of the project.

    \endlist
