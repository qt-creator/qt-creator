    \b {Why are custom widgets not loaded in Design mode even though it
    works in standalone Qt Designer?}

    Qt Designer fetches plugins from standard locations and loads the plugins
    that match its build key. The locations are different for standalone and
    integrated Qt Designer.

    For more information, see \l{Adding Qt Designer Plugins}.
