    \title Developing Widget Based Applications

    \QC automatically opens all .ui files in the integrated \QD, in \uicontrol Design
    mode.

    For more information about \QD, see the \l{Qt Designer Manual}.

    Generally, the integrated \QD contains the same functions as the standalone
    \QD. The following sections describe the differences.

    \section1 Code Editor Integration

    To switch between forms (\uicontrol Design mode) and code (\uicontrol Edit mode),
    press \key Shift+F4.

    You can use \QC to create stub implementations of slot functions. In the
    \uicontrol Design mode, right-click a widget to open a context menu, and then
    select \uicontrol {Go to Slot}. Select a signal in the list to go to an existing
    slot function or to create a new slot function.

    \section1 Managing Image Resources

    In standalone \QD, image resources are created using the built-in
    \uicontrol {Resource Editor}. In \QC, .ui files are usually part of a project,
    which may contain several resource files (.qrc). They are created and
    maintained by using the \QC Resource Editor. The \QD \uicontrol {Resource Editor}
    is de-activated and the image resources are displayed in the \QD
    \uicontrol {Resource Browser}.

    \section1 Specifying Settings for Qt Designer

    You can drag and drop the views in \QD to new positions on the screen.

    To specify settings for \QD:

    \list

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Designer.

        \li Specify settins for generating classes and code in \uicontrol {Class
            Generation}.

        \li Specify embedded device profiles, that determine style, font, and
            screen resolution, for example, in \uicontrol{Embedded Design}.

        \li Specify settings for the grid and previewing forms in \uicontrol Forms.

        \li Specify an additional folder for saving templates in \uicontrol{Template
            Paths}.

    \endlist

    To preview the settings, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol{Form Editor} >
    \uicontrol Preview, or press \key Alt+Shift+R.

    \section1 Previewing Forms Using Device Skins

    A \e {device skin} is a set of configuration files that describe a mobile
    device. It includes a border image that surrounds the form and depicts a
    mobile device with its buttons.

    To preview your form using device skins:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Designer.

        \li Select the \uicontrol{Print/Preview Configuration} check box.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Device skin} field, select a device skin.

        \li When the form is open in \uicontrol Design mode, press \key Alt+Shift+R.

        \li To end the preview, right-click the skin and select \uicontrol Close in
            the context menu.

    \endlist

    \section1 Adding Widgets

    You can use Qt APIs to create plugins that extend Qt applications. This
    enables you to add your own widgets to \QD. For more information, see
    \l{Adding Qt Designer Plugins}.
