The main idea behind this plugin is to provide additional actions a typical emacs user would expect. It doesn&#39;t claim to provide full emacs emulation. The following actions are available:
 - Movement [C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p, M-f, M-b, C-a, C-e, M-&lt;, M-&gt;]
 - Mark-based selection [C-SPC, C-x C-x]
 - Cut/copy/yank (doesn&#39;t provide kill ring feature) [M-w, C-w, C-y]
 - Kill actions, which interact properly with clipboard [C-k, M-d, C-d]
 - Scrolling (half of the screen, keeps cursor visible) [C-v, M-v]
 - Insert new line and indent [C-j]

IMPORTANT: Actions are not bound to any key combinations by default. You can find them under &#39;EmacsKeys&#39; section in keyboard shortcuts settings.

Also it&#39;s worth mentioning that EmacsKeys plugin forces disabling of menu mnemonics by calling Qt&#39;s qt_set_sequence_auto_mnemonic function with false argument. Many of the english menu mnemonics get into the way of typical emacs keys, this includes: Alt+F (File), Alt+B (Build), Alt+W (Window). It&#39;s a temporary solution, it remains until there is a better one.
