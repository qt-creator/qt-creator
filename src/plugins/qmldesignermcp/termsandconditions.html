</p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
   These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the access and use of Qt AI (as defined below).
   These Terms supplement the Agreement between Customer ("Customer") and <strong>The Qt Company</strong>
   to provide terms specific to the use of Qt AI. By using Qt AI, Customer agrees to be bound by these Terms.
   If Customer does not wish to accept these Terms, Customer should not use Qt AI.
</p>
<p><strong>1.1.</strong> These Terms govern the use of AI services provided by The Qt Company designed to enhance, improve or automate Customer's experience with the Services (including Licensed Software) through AI offerings.
   This may include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data analytics,
   and integration or use of third-party large language models.
</p>
<p><strong>1.2.</strong> Qt AI may provide functionality that interfaces with third party AI offerings (e.g., LLMs as defined below) in order to obtain output or suggestions for Customer.
   Customer is solely responsible for selecting the information to be shared with Qt AI and ensuring Customer's ability to share any information with The Qt Company, including Qt AI.
</p>

   used for the purposes of operation or in connection with the Qt AI, based on the selection of The Qt Company or Customer.
</p>
<h3>3. Use of Qt AI</h3>
<p><strong>3.1.</strong> In order to use Qt AI, Customer must have an Agreement and a valid active subscription license for applicable Licensed Software
   (e.g. for Qt AI Assistant, either a Commercial Qt Design Studio, Qt for Application Development Enterprise or a Qt for Device Creation license is needed).
   User restrictions apply as per the Agreement.
</p>
<p><strong>3.2.</strong> Use of AI Assistant further requires that Customer connect to at least one LLM.
   Such LLM may be operated by Customer or a third party. Use of such an LLM is at Customer's discretion,
   subject to any restrictions, requirements or contractual terms between Customer and the LLM, and Customer is responsible for ensuring that it can use such an LLM in conjunction with Qt AI,
   including the AI Assistant. Documentation provides further LLM compatibility information.
</p>
<p><strong>3.3.</strong> The accuracy and suitability of Outputs for a given application or situation must be confirmed and accepted by the Customer,
   and Customer is responsible for evaluating whether the Outputs are correct and fit for a particular purpose.
   To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Qt Company disclaims all warranties, guarantees, and responsibilities for the accuracy, suitability, or fitness of Outputs.
</p>
<p><strong>3.4.</strong> When using Qt Design Studio AI Assistant, Customer must acknowledge that existing QML source code and information about assets in the project is shared with the LLM.
   Qt Company is not responsible of any IPR related information leaks caused by the usage of Qt AI Assistant.
</p>
<h3>4. Prohibited Use</h3>
<p>Customer is prohibited from using Qt AI in any way that would violate applicable laws.
   Customer must not use Qt AI in a way that would breach any intellectual property rights of third parties or The Qt Company.
</p>
<h3>5. Limitations</h3>
<p>Where Qt AI involves the use of an LLM, Customer may not utilize an LLM that represents, purports, or otherwise attempts to take ownership of (or license to) the Intellectual Property of The Qt Company.
   In using any LLM or other Third-Party Software, Customer will abide by all applicable license terms of such Third-Party Software, including any terms of use or restrictions on use.
</p>
<h3>6. Intellectual Property Rights and Ownership</h3>
<p><strong>6.1. Ownership of The Qt Company.</strong> The Qt Company owns, or has the right to use, all the proprietary and intellectual property rights to Qt AI.
   This includes all Qt AI-related trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, other registered or unregistered intellectual property, and system-generated data.
   System-generated data includes, but is not limited to, aggregate anonymized data on how Qt AI is used, system logs, metadata, registration and login data, but does not include Input or Outputs.
   Use of Qt AI in no way transfers any intellectual property of The Qt Company to Customer other than the limited rights to use Qt Services (including Qt AI) in accordance with these Terms and the Agreement.
</p>
<p><strong>6.2. Ownership of Customer.</strong> Except to the extent explicitly set forth in these Terms or the Agreement, as between the Customer and The Qt Company (and to the extent permitted by applicable law),
   Customer owns the Inputs and Customer's data and retains all proprietary rights, including intellectual property rights thereof.
</p>
<div style="margin-left:1em;">
   <p><strong>6.2.1.</strong> By submitting an Input to Qt AI, Customer represents and warrants that Customer has the right to submit the Input and further understands that Customer is doing so at its own risk
      and is solely responsible for this step and all consequences of its use in Qt AI.
   </p>
   <p><strong>6.2.2. Customer rights to Outputs</strong></p>
   <div style="margin-left:1em;">
      <p><strong>6.2.2.1.</strong> The Outputs generated for Customer will be considered the Customer's Outputs, and The Qt Company will not claim any right to, title to, or interest in Customer's Outputs.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, any The Qt Company Intellectual Property contained within the Outputs remains the intellectual property of The Qt Company and its licensors and is subject to the applicable terms and conditions regarding such intellectual property (e.g., the Agreement).
         Customer acknowledges that Outputs are generated as a non-exclusive response to the work with Qt AI, so the same or similar Outputs, or other suggestions may also be generated for other Qt AI customers, based on inputs or context of use.
      </p>
      <p><strong>6.2.2.2.</strong> In regards to AI Assistant, the Outputs are generated by the use of AI Assistant in conjunction with Third-Party Software and as such, may be subject to third-party rights, including open-source licenses.
         Consequently, Customer must ensure that the Output generated by AI Assistant does not violate third-party rights, such as open-source software licenses.
      </p>
   </div>
</div>
<p><strong>6.3. Feedback.</strong> Customer gives The Qt Company the right to use, change, modify, commercialize, and incorporate into Qt AI any of the ideas, suggestions, recommendations, proposals, or other feedback provided by Customer relating to Qt AI—which shall constitute Submitted Modified Software.
   This permission is irrevocable and perpetual. The Qt Company is not required to pay a fee for this feedback and is entitled to transfer and give similar rights ('sublicense') to the Submitted Modified Software as it sees fit.
</p>
<p><strong>6.4. Access to data.</strong> If applicable to Qt AI offerings, Customer gives The Qt Company permission to access its Input to provide Customer with the Qt AI.
   The Qt Company will not use any of Customer's data to train The Qt Company's or third-party models unless explicitly agreed to do so in writing.
   For the purpose of providing Customer with Support, The Qt Company is given the permission to access the Customer's Input, Output, and other data, to the extent required by the Support.
</p>
<h3>7. Indemnification</h3>
<p><strong>7.1.</strong> The Qt Company shall indemnify and defend Customer from and against any third-party claims, actions, or demands alleging that the Qt AI, or any part thereof (but excluding any LLM or other Third-Party Software),
   infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property rights of any third party (a "Customer Claim").
</p>
<p><strong>7.2.</strong> Customer shall indemnify and defend The Qt Company, its officers, directors, and employees (collectively, the "Qt Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third-party claims, actions, or demands
   (including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) arising out of or related to: (i) any misuse or improper use of Qt AI by Customer or by any third party acting on its behalf, including but not limited to the violation of any laws, regulations, or third-party rights (including intellectual property rights);
   (ii) the Inputs and Outputs Customer submits, transmits, generates, or uses in connection with Qt AI, including any alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, defamation, violation of privacy, fraudulent or malicious activities, or other legal rights of third parties;
   (iii) breach of these Terms by Customer, including but not limited to breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or intellectual property provisions; and (iv) any claim resulting from any action or the Customer's Input into or Outputs from the Qt AI that results in harm to The Qt Company,
   other users, or third parties, such as engaging in illegal, fraudulent, or malicious activities, including those resulting from Submitted Modified Software (each, a "Qt Claim").
</p>
<p><strong>7.3.</strong> Customer Claims and Qt Claims are collectively referred to herein as "Claim(s)."</p>
<p><strong>7.4.</strong> The party seeking indemnification shall promptly notify the other party of a Claim, allow the other party sole right to control the defense and provide reasonable information and assistance (at the indemnifying party's expense) in the defense of the Claim.</p>
<p><strong>7.5.</strong> Provided that the party seeking indemnification has done so, the indemnifying party shall indemnify any amounts the party seeking indemnification is ordered to pay to a third party right-holder in a non-cancellable decision of the applicable court or in a valid out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p><strong>7.6.</strong> The Qt Company shall have no obligation to defend or indemnify Customer to the extent that a Claim is based on: (i) any modification to the Qt AI and/or other Services made by anyone other than The Qt Company, or any version of the Qt AI and/or Services other than the unmodified and updated Qt AI and/or Services delivered by The Qt Company;
   (ii) the particular use made by Customer of the Qt AI and/or Services; (iii) the functionality created by Customer using the Qt AI and/or Services, in Customer's Device or Application; (iv) any Third-Party Software; (v) the use of any version of the Qt AI and/or Services which has been superseded by a new or updated version of Qt AI and/or Services that The Qt Company has made generally available under Support;
   or (vi) any Intellectual Property Right in which Customer or any Affiliate of Customer has a proprietary interest. In the event that a Claim arises, or, in The Qt Company's reasonable opinion is likely to arise, The Qt Company shall either (i) modify the Qt AI and/or Services to avoid infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality;
   (ii) obtain for Customer the right to use the Qt AI free of any claim of infringement; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing is reasonably available, accept return of the Qt AI and/or Services from Customer and refund to Customer all fees paid with respect to the Services not useable by Customer as a result of the infringement.
   Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, for any and all Claims based on the allegation that the Qt AI and/or Services or its use infringes on the patent rights of a third party, The Qt Company's total maximum liability towards the Customer under these Terms shall be limited to (i) the costs of performing its obligations under this Section 7, and, in addition (ii) an amount equal to the Fees paid by Customer under the Agreement.
   This Section states the entire liability of The Qt Company with respect to indemnification or liability for infringement of Intellectual Property Rights by the Qt AI or any part thereof or by their use or operation.
