    \class ProjectExplorer::BuildStep

    \brief The BuildStep class provides build steps for projects.

    Build steps are the primary way plugin developers can customize
    how their projects (or projects from other plugins) are built.

    Projects are built by taking the list of build steps
    from the project and calling first \c init() and then \c run() on them.

    To change the way your project is built, reimplement
    this class and add your build step to the build step list of the project.

    \note The projects own the build step. Do not delete them yourself.

    \c init() is called in the GUI thread and can be used to query the
    project for any information you need.

    \c run() is run via QtConcurrent in a separate thread. If you need an
    event loop, you need to create it yourself.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::init()

    This function is run in the GUI thread. Use it to retrieve any information
    that you need in the run() function.
*/

/*!
    \fn void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::run(QFutureInterface<bool> &fi)

    Reimplement this function. It is called when the target is built.
    By default, this function is NOT run in the GUI thread, but runs in its
    own thread. If you need an event loop, you need to create one.
    This function should block until the task is done

    The absolute minimal implementation is:
    \code
    fi.reportResult(true);
    \endcode

    By returning \c true from runInGuiThread(), this function is called in
    the GUI thread. Then the function should not block and instead the
    finished() signal should be emitted.

    \sa runInGuiThread()
*/

/*!
    \fn BuildStepConfigWidget *ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::createConfigWidget()

    Returns the Widget shown in the target settings dialog for this build step.
    Ownership is transferred to the caller.
*/

/*!
    \fn  void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::addTask(const ProjectExplorer::Task &task)
    Adds \a task.
*/

/*!
    \fn  void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::addOutput(const QString &string, ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::OutputFormat format,
              ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::OutputNewlineSetting newlineSetting = DoAppendNewline) const

    The \a string is added to the generated output, usually in the output pane.
    It should be in plain text, with the format in the parameter.
*/

/*!
    \fn  void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::finished()
    This signal needs to be emitted if the build step runs in the GUI thread.
