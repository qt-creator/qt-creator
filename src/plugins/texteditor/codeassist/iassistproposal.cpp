    \title Code Assist for Editors

    Code assist is available in the form of completions and refactoring actions pop-ups
    which are triggered under particular circumstances. This group contains the classes
    used to provide such support.

    Completions can be of a variety of kind like function hints, snippets, and regular
    context-aware content. The later are usually represented by semantic proposals, but
    it is also possible that they are simply plain text like in the fake vim mode.

    Completions also have the possibility to run asynchronously in a separate thread and
    then not blocking the GUI. This is the default behavior.

/*!
    \class TextEditor::IAssistProposal
    \brief The IAssistProposal class acts as an interface for representing an assist proposal.
    \ingroup CodeAssist

    Known implenters of this interface are FunctionHintProposal and GenericProposal. The
    former is recommended to be used when assisting function call constructs (overloads
    and parameters) while the latter is quite generic so that it could be used to propose
    snippets, refactoring operations (quickfixes), and contextual content (the member of
    class or a string existent in the document, for example).

    This class is part of the CodeAssist API.

    idle editor.

    is GenericProposalWidget.
