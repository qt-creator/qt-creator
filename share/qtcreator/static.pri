# This pri file is used to deploy files that are not compiled while building
# Qt Creator. It handles copying of files into the build directory if using
# a shadow build and adds the respective install target as well.
#
# Usage: Define variables (details below) and include this pri file afterwards.
#
# STATIC_BASE    - base directory for the files listed in STATIC_FILES
# STATIC_FILES   - list of files to be deployed
