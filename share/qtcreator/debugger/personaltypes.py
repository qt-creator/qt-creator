# This is a place to add your own dumpers for testing purposes.
# Any contents here will be picked up by GDB and LLDB based
# debugging in Qt Creator automatically. This code is not used
# when debugging with CDB on Windows.

# NOTE: This file will get overwritten when updating Qt Creator.
#
# To add dumpers that don't get overwritten, copy this file here
# to a safe location outside the Qt Creator installation and
# make this location known to Qt Creator using the  Debugger /
# GDB / Dumper customization / Additional file  setting.

# Example to display a simple type
# template<typename U, typename V> struct MapNode
# {
#     U key;
#     V data;
# }
#
# def qdump__MapNode(d, value):
#    d.putValue("This is the value column contents")
#    d.putNumChild(2)
#    if d.isExpanded():
#        with Children(d):
#            # Compact simple case.
#            d.putSubItem("key", value["key"])
#            # Same effect, with more customization possibilities.
#            with SubItem(d, "data")
#                d.putItem("data", value["data"])

# Check http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-3.2/creator-debugging-helpers.html
