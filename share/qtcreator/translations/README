How To add translations to Qt Creator
=====================================

- Coordinate over the mailing list to avoid duplicate work.

- Read the instructions at http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Localization

- Add your language to the LANGUAGES line in translations.pro.
  Don't qualify it with a country unless it is reasonable to expect
  country-specific variants.
  Skip this step if updating an existing translation, obviously.

- Run "make ts-<lang>".

  If your Qt version is too old, you may create a template by running
    lconvert --drop-translations qtcreator_de.ts -o qtcreator_<yours>.ts
  and adjusting the language attribute in the new .ts file. The downside
  of this method is obviously that you will not be translating the newest
  Creator sources (unless qtcreator_de.ts was completely up-to-date).
  Of course, this method is not applicable if you are updating an existing
  translation.

  You may also request an up-to-date template from us.

- Fire up linguist and do the translation.

- Create a commit:
  - Discard the modifications to any .ts files except yours
  - Run "make commit-ts" to create a commit with a cleaned .ts file
  - If needed, amend the commit with the modified .pro file

- Follow http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Contribution_Guidelines to post the
  change for review.

- .qm files are generated as part of the regular build.

Note: QmlDesigner contains code from the Gradient Editor of Qt Designer.
If an official translation of Qt for your language exists, you can
re-use the translation of those messages by merging Qt Creator's and
Qt Designer's translation using lconvert:

lconvert qtcreator_<LANG>.ts $QTDIR/translations/designer_<LANG>.ts > temp.ts

Move the temporary file back to qtcreator_<LANG>.ts, complete the
Gradient Editor's translations and update the file, passing the
additional option -noobsolete to lupdate (by temporarily modifying
translations.pro). This will remove the now redundant messages originating
from Qt Designer.
