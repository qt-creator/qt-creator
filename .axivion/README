axivion config used by CI to run analysis on Linux using gcc

If you want to use this ensure that prerequisites are met:
 * axivion needs to be installed $HOME/bauhaus-suite and correctly set up
   (for different locations start_ci.sh needs to get adapted)
 * axivion license needs to be present
 * cmake and ninja need to be in PATH
 * gcc/g++ needs to be in PATH
 * QT_DIR must be set to a Qt to build QC with (e.g. "$HOME/Qt/6.9.2/gcc_64")
 * LLVM_INSTALL_DIR must be set to a supported libclang installation
 * additional requirements may apply - or may be disabled by respective environment variables
   (please, refer to the official README.md inside the QC repostiory top level)

Using start_ci.sh recreates the compiler_config.json automatically.

If not using the start_ci.sh script you need to explicitly create the compiler_config.json
yourself. To do so, set the BAUHAUS_CONFIG environment variable to this folder,
source either bauhaus-kshrc or bauhaus-cshrc from the Axivion installation folder and run
gccsetup afterwards.
