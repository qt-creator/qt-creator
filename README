Qt Creator
==========
Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE for development with the Qt framework.

Supported Platforms
===================
The standalone binary packages support the following platforms:

Windows XP SP3 or later
(K)Ubuntu Linux 11.10 (32-bit and 64-bit) or later
Mac OS X 10.7 or later

Building the sources requires Qt 5.2.0 or later.
It is also possible to build with Qt 4.8.x, but in that case the Welcome mode,
Qt Quick Designer, QML Profiler, and the WinRT and Qbs support are disabled.

Compiling Qt Creator
====================
Prerequisites:
   * Qt 5.2.0 or later (with restrictions also Qt 4.8.x)
   * On Windows:
     -  ActiveState Active Perl
     -  MinGW or Visual Studio 2010 or later
     -  jom
   * On Mac OS X: latest Xcode

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Qt Creator with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Note: If you use Qt 4.8 to build on OS X, you need to additionally pass
      "-spec unsupported/macx-clang-libc++" to qmake.

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

Private Header Dependencies When Compiling With Qt 4.8
------------------------------------------------------

The QNX plugin, and on Windows the Utils library, use
private headers of Qt. These private headers always end with an "_p.h". Digia
and the Qt Project do not promise to keep these files or APIs binary or source
compatible between releases. This means that when compiled, Qt Creator has a
dependency to the exact Qt version it was compiled with. Running Qt Creator
against updated Qt libraries (also for patch releases) might lead to link time
failures, or even crashes.

To disable the plugins, pass "QT_PRIVATE_HEADERS=" to qmake:

  qmake "QT_PRIVATE_HEADERS=" $SOURCE_DIRECTORY/qtcreator.pro

Compiling Qt and Qt Creator on Windows
--------------------------------------

This section provides step by step instructions for compiling the latest
versions of Qt and Qt Creator on Windows. Alternatively, to avoid having to
compile Qt yourself, you can use one of the versions of Qt shipped with the Qt
SDK (release builds of Qt using MinGW and Visual C++ 2010 or later).
For detailed information on the supported compilers, see
http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_Qt_5_from_Git .

   1.  Decide which compiler to use: MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio. If you
       plan to contribute to Qt Creator, you should compile your changes with
       both compilers.

   2.  Install msysGit from http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/. If you plan to
       use the MinGW compiler suite, do not choose to put git in the
       default path of Windows command prompts. For more information, see
       step 9.

   3.  Create a working directory under which to check out Qt and Qt Creator,
       for example, c:\work. If you plan to use MinGW and Microsoft Visual
       Studio simultaneously or mix different Qt versions, we recommend
       creating a directory structure which reflects that. For example:
       C:\work\qt5.2.1-vs10, C:\work\qt5.2.1-mingw.

   4.  Download and install Perl from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl
       and check that perl.exe is added to the path. Run perl -v to verify
       that the version displayed is 5.10 or later. Note that git ships
       an outdated version 5.8 which cannot be used for Qt.

   5.  In the working directory, check out the respective branch of Qt
       (we recommend the latest released version from the release branch,
       5.2.1; see https://qt.gitorious.org/qt).

   6.  Check out Qt Creator (master branch or latest version, see
       https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator).
       You should now have the directories qt and creator under your working
       directory.

   7.  Install a compiler:
       - For a MinGW toolchain for Qt, see http://qt-project.org/wiki/MinGW .

       - For Microsoft Visual C++, install the Windows SDK and the "Debugging
         Tools for Windows" from the SDK image. We strongly recommend using the
         64-bit version and 64-bit compilers on 64-bit systems.

         When using Visual C++ 2010, you must apply a hotfix that is available
         from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2280741
         (See https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-11445).

         For the Visual C++ compilers, it is recommended to use the tool 'jom'.
         It is a replacement for nmake that utilizes all CPU cores and thus
         speeds up compilation significantly. Download it from
         http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/jom
         and add the executable to the path.

   8.  For convenience, we recommend creating shell prompts with the correct
       environment. This can be done by creating a .bat-file
       (such as, <working_directory>\qtvars.bat) that contains the environment
       variable settings.
       A .bat-file for MinGW looks like:

         set PATH=<path_to_qt>\[qtbase\]bin;<path_to_mingw>\bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-g++

       For the Visual C++ compilers, call the .bat file that sets up the
       environment for the compiler (provided by the Windows SDK or the
       compiler):

         CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSVC10\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
         set PATH=<path_to_qt>\[qtbase\]bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2010

       You can create desktop links to the bat files using the working
       directory and specifying

       %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /E:ON /V:ON  /k <working_directory>\qtvars.bat

   9.  When using MinGW, open the shell prompt and enter:

       sh.exe

       That should result in a 'sh is not recognized as internal or external
       command...' error. If a sh.exe is found, the compile process will fail.
       You have to remove it from the path.

  10.  You are now ready to configure and build Qt and Qt Creator.
       Please see http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_Qt_5_from_Git for
       recommended configure-options for Qt 5.
       To use MinGW, open the the shell prompt and enter:

         cd <path_to_qt>
         configure <configure_options> && mingw32-make -s
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && mingw32-make -s

       To use the Visual C++ compilers, enter:

         cd <path_to_qt>
         configure <configure_options> && jom
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && jom

   11. To launch Qt Creator, enter:
       qtcreator

   12. When using  Visual C++ with the "Debugging Tools for Windows" installed,
       the extension library qtcreatorcdbext.dll to be loaded into the
       Windows console debugger (cdb.exe) should have been built under
       lib\qtcreatorcdbext32 or lib\qtcreatorcdbext64.
       When using a 32 bit-build of Qt Creator with the 64 bit version of the
       "Debugging Tools for Windows" the library should also be built with
       a 64 bit compiler (rebuild src\libs\qtcreatorcdbext using a 64 bit
       compiler).

       If you are building 32 bit and running on a 64 bit
       Windows, you can obtain the 64 bit versions of the extension library
       and the binary win64interrupt.exe, which is required for
       debugging from the repository
       https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/binary-artifacts/source/ .

   13. Qt Creator can be registered as a post-mortem debugger. This
       can be done in the options page or by running the tool qtcdebugger
       with administrative privileges passing the command line options
       -register/unregister, respectively. Alternatively,
       the required registry entries
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug and
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug
       can be modified using the registry editor regedt32 to contain
       <path>\qt-creator\bin\qtcdebugger %ld %ld

       When using a self-built version of Qt Creator as post-mortem debugger, it needs to be
       able to find all dependent Qt-libraries and plugins when being launched by the
       system. The easiest way to provide them for Qt 5 is to run the tool windeployqt:

       windeployqt -svg -xml -designercomponents -script -concurrent -network -quick -test -sql -printsupport -qthelp -qmldir share\qtcreator -qmldir src\plugins\qmlprofiler bin\qtcreator.exe

Note that unlike on Unix, you cannot overwrite executables that are running.
Thus, if you want to work on Qt Creator using Qt Creator, you need a
separate build of it. We recommend using a separate, release-built version
of Qt and Qt Creator to work on a debug-built version of Qt and Qt Creator
or using shadow builds.
