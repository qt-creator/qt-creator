Qt Creator
==========
Qt Creator is a cross-platform C++ IDE for development with the Qt framework.

Supported Platforms
===================
The binary packages support the following platforms:

Windows 7, Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista
(K)Ubuntu Linux 8.04 (32-bit and 64-bit) or later
Mac OS 10.5 or later

Building the sources requires Qt 4.8.0 or later.

Compiling Qt Creator
====================
Prerequisites:
   * Qt 4.8.0
   * On Windows:
     -  ActiveState Active Perl
     -  MinGW 4.4 or later, Visual Studio 2008 or later
     -  jom
     The Qt SDK provides you with most of the required software.
   * On Mac: XCode 2.5 or later, compiling on 10.4 requires setting the
     environment variable QTC_TIGER_COMPAT before running qmake

You can build Qt Creator with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Note: If you get "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop."
      on Mac OS X, you need to additionally pass "-spec macx-g++" to qmake.

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

Compiling Qt Quick Designer
---------------------------

Qt Quick Designer (QmlDesigner plugin) depends on "private" headers from Qt
4.8.0, specifically from the QtDeclarative module. These private headers always
end with an "_p.h". Digia does not promise to keep these files or APIs binary
or source compatible between releases. This means that when compiled, the
plugin has a dependency to the exact Qt version it was compiled with. Running
Qt Creator with the plugin against updated Qt libraries (also for patch
releases) might lead to link time failures, or even crashes.

If you want to disable the plugin, you can pass "QT_PRIVATE_HEADERS=" to qmake:

  qmake "QT_PRIVATE_HEADERS=" $SOURCE_DIRECTORY/qtcreator.pro

The plugin is not compiled if the private header files are not found. This
might be the case when you use a Qt version from your distribution, or
installed a self-compiled Qt to a separate directory via 'make install'. You
can fix this by either re-building your Qt with the "-developer-build"
configure option, or by passing the include directory in the source directory
to qmake. For example:

  qmake "QT_PRIVATE_HEADERS=$$QT_BUILD_TREE/include" $SOURCE_DIRECTORY/qtcreator.pro


Compiling Qt and Qt Creator on Windows
--------------------------------------

This section provides step by step instructions for compiling the latest
versions of Qt and Qt Creator on Windows. Alternatively, to avoid having to
compile Qt yourself, you can use one of the versions of Qt shipped with the Qt
SDK (release builds of Qt using MinGW and Visual C++ 2008).

   1.  Decide which compiler to use: MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio. If you
       plan to contribute to Qt Creator, you should compile your changes with
       both compilers.

   2.  Install msysGit from http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/. If you plan to
       use the MinGW compiler suite, do not choose to put git in the
       default path of Windows command prompts. For more information, see
       step 9.

   3.  Create a working directory under which to check out Qt and Qt Creator,
       for example, c:\work. If you plan to use MinGW and Microsoft Visual
       Studio simultaneously or mix different Qt versions, we recommend
       creating a directory structure which reflects that. For example:
       C:\work\qt4.7.1-vs10, C:\work\qt4.7.2-mingw.

   4.  Download and install Perl from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl
       and check that perl.exe is added to the path.

   5.  In the working directory, check out the respective branch of Qt
       (we recommend 4.7; see http://qt.gitorious.org/qt).

   6.  Check out Qt Creator (master branch, see
       http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator).
       You should now have the directories qt and creator under your working
       directory.

   7.  Install a compiler:
       - For MinGW (4.4 onwards), see http://www.mingw.org/. Note that gcc 4.5
         produces insufficient debugging information, and therefore, we
         recommend that you use gcc 4.4 for debugging.

       - For Microsoft Visual C++, install the Windows SDK and the "Debugging
         Tools for Windows" from the SDK image. We strongly recommend using the
         64-bit version and 64-bit compilers on 64-bit systems.

         When using Visual C++ 2010, you must apply a hotfix that is available
         from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2280741
         (See https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-11445).

         For the Visual C++ compilers, it is recommended to use the tool 'jom'.
         It is a replacement for nmake that utilizes all CPU cores and thus
         speeds up compilation significantly. Download it from
         http://releases.qt-project.org/jom/ and add the executable to the path.

   8.  For convenience, we recommend creating shell prompts with the correct
       environment. This can be done by creating a .bat-file
       (such as, <working_directory>\qtvars.bat) that contains the environment
       variable settings.
       A .bat-file for MinGW looks like:

         set QTDIR=<working_directory>\qt
         set PATH=%QTDIR%\bin;<path_to_mingw>\bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-g++

       For the Visual C++ compilers, call the .bat file that sets up the
       environment for the compiler (provided by the Windows SDK or the
       compiler):

         CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSVC10\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
         set QTDIR=<working_directory>\qt
         set PATH=%QTDIR%\bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2010

       You can create desktop links to the bat files using the working
       directory and specifying

       %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /E:ON /V:ON  /k <working_directory>\qtvars.bat

   9.  When using MinGW, open the shell prompt and enter:

       sh.exe

       That should result in a 'sh is not recognized as internal or external
       command...' error. If a sh.exe is found, the compile process will fail.
       You have to remove it from the path.

  10.  You are now ready to configure and build Qt and Qt Creator.
       To use MinGW, open the the shell prompt and enter:

         cd qt
         configure -debug && mingw32-make -s
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && mingw32-make -s

       To use the Visual C++ compilers, enter:

         cd qt
         configure -debug && jom
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && jom

   11. To launch Qt Creator, enter:
       qtcreator

   12. When using  Visual C++ with the "Debugging Tools for Windows" installed,
       the extension library qtcreatorcdbext.dll to be loaded into the
       Windows console debugger (cdb.exe) should have been built under
       lib\qtcreatorcdbext32 or lib\qtcreatorcdbext64.
       When using a 32 bit-build of Qt Creator with the 64 bit version of the
       "Debugging Tools for Windows" the library should also be built with
       a 64 bit compiler (rebuild src\libs\qtcreatorcdbext using a 64 bit
       compiler).

Note that unlike on Unix, you cannot overwrite executables that are running.
Thus, if you want to work on Qt Creator using Qt Creator, you need a
separate build of it. We recommend using a separate, release-built version
of Qt and Qt Creator to work on a debug-built version of Qt and Qt Creator
or using shadow builds.
